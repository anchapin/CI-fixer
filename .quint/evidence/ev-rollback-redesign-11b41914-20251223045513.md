# Evidence: Rollback Path Verification and Redesign with Test-First Approach

**Evidence ID:** `ev-rollback-redesign-11b41914-20251223045513`  
**Holon ID:** `rollback-redesign-11b41914`  
**Type:** deduction  
**Verdict:** PASS  
**Assurance Level:** high

## Verification Checks

### Type Check: PASS
Kind='episteme' matches process change for development workflow.

### Constraint Check: PASS
STRONGLY ALIGNED with TDD Workflow invariant: 'All features MUST start with failing tests'. Path Verification feature should follow this. Conductor workflow supports checkpoint/rollback approach.

### Logic Check: PASS
Method is sound: write tests first (Red), implement to pass (Green), refactor (Refactor). This is the core TDD principle. Logical consistency guaranteed by following established workflow.

### Notes
Most aligned with project invariants. TDD is a MANDATORY invariant per workflow.md line 30.
