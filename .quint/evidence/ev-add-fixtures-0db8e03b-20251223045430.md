**Assurance Level:** high

## Verification Checks

### Type Check: PASS
Kind='episteme' matches process/documentation change for test infrastructure.

### Constraint Check: PASS
Respects TDD workflow invariant. Supports Coverage Requirement (>80%) by making tests more maintainable. Reduces duplication (DRY principle).

### Logic Check: PASS
Shared fixtures will reduce code duplication across tests. Method leads to more maintainable test suite. Logical consistency: centralizing mocks improves consistency.

### Notes
Moderate approach balancing maintainability and implementation effort. Aligns with DRY principle from workflow.md.
