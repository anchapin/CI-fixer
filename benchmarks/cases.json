If the issue is urgent or sensitive in nature (e.g., a security vulnerability) please send an e-mail directly to the private e-mail feedback@astropy.org.\n@bmorris3 , do you think this is related to that nddata feature you added in v5.3?\nHi @KathleenLabrie. I'm not sure this is a bug, because as far as I can tell the `mask` in NDData is assumed to be boolean: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/83f6f002fb11853eacb689781d366be6aa170e0e/astropy/nddata/nddata.py#L51-L55\r\n\r\nThere are updates to the propagation logic in v5.3 that allow for more flexible and customizable mask propagation, see discussion in https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/14175.\r\n\r\nYou're using the `bitwise_or` operation, which is different from the default `logical_or` operation in important ways. I tested your example using `logical_or` and it worked as expected, with the caveat that your mask becomes booleans with `True` for non-zero initial mask values.\nWe are doing data reduction.  The nature of the \"badness\" of each pixel matters.  True or False does not cut it.  That why we need bits.  This is scientifically required.   A saturated pixel is different from a non-linear pixel, different from an unilliminated pixels, different .... etc. \r\n\r\nI don't see why a feature that had been there for a long time was removed without even a deprecation warning.\nBTW, I still think that something is broken, eg.\r\n```\r\n>>> bmask = np.array([[True, False, False], [False, True, False], [False, False, True]])\r\n>>> nref_bmask = NDDataRef(array, mask=bmask)\r\n>>> nref_bmask.multiply(1.).mask\r\narray([[True, None, None],\r\n       [None, True, None],\r\n       [None, None, True]], dtype=object)\r\n```\r\nThose `None`s should probably be `False`s not None's\nThere is *absolutely* a bug here. Here's a demonstration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> data = np.arange(4).reshape(2,2)\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]]))\r\n>>> nd1 = NDDataRef(data, mask=mask)\r\n>>> nd2 = NDDataRef(data, mask=None)\r\n>>> nd1.multiply(nd2, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or)\r\n...Exception...\r\n>>> nd2.multiply(nd1, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or)\r\nNDDataRef([[0, 1],\r\n           [4, 9]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiplication is commutative and should still be here. In 5.2 the logic for arithmetic between two objects was that if one didn't have a `mask` or the `mask` was `None` then the output mask would be the `mask` of the other. That seems entirely sensible and I see no sensible argument for changing that. But in 5.3 the logic is that if the first operand has no mask then the output will be the mask of the second, but if the second operand has no mask then it sends both masks to the `handle_mask` function (instead of simply setting the output to the mask of the first as before).\r\n\r\nNote that this has an unwanted effect *even if the masks are boolean*:\r\n```\r\n>>> bool_mask = mask.astype(bool)\r\n>>> nd1 = NDDataRef(data, mask=bool_mask)\r\n>>> nd2.multiply(nd1).mask\r\narray([[False,  True],\r\n       [ True, False]])\r\n>>> nd1.multiply(nd2).mask\r\narray([[None, True],\r\n       [True, None]], dtype=object)\r\n```\r\nand, whoops, the `mask` isn't a nice happy numpy `bool` array anymore.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like somebody accidentally turned the lines\r\n\r\n```\r\nelif operand.mask is None:\r\n            return deepcopy(self.mask)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n```\r\nelif operand is None:\r\n            return deepcopy(self.mask)\r\n```\r\n\n@chris-simpson I agree that line you suggested above is the culprit, which was [changed here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/commit/feeb716b7412c477c694648ee1e93be2c4a73700#diff-5057de973eaa1e5036a0bef89e618b1b03fd45a9c2952655abb656822f4ddc2aL458-R498). I've reverted that specific line in a local astropy branch and verified that the existing tests still pass, and the bitmask example from @KathleenLabrie works after that line is swapped. I'll make a PR to fix this today, with a new test to make sure that we don't break this again going forward. \nMany thanks for working on this, @bmorris3.\r\n\r\nRegarding whether the `mask` is assumed to be Boolean, I had noticed in the past that some developers understood this to be the case, while others disagreed. When we discussed this back in 2016, however (as per the document you linked to in Slack), @eteq explained that the mask is just expected to be \"truthy\" in a NumPy sense of zero = False (unmasked) and non-zero = True (masked), which you'll see is consistent with the doc string you cited above, even if it's not entirely clear :slightly_frowning_face:.\nOf course I think that flexibility is great, but I think intentional ambiguity in docs is risky when only one of the two cases is tested. 😬 \nIndeed, I should probably have checked that there was a test for this upstream, since I was aware of some confusion; if only we could find more time to work on these important common bits that we depend on...",

        "initialContext": "Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

I guess the question is whether or not that documentation should be duplicated elsewhere.\nThank you Tim, this is precisely what I was looking for! I can only see one issue with the current docs (if you excuse me for bothering you with such minor details). ​The documentation for the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting reads: If this isn’t given or is None, you’ll get operating-system dependent behavior. On most platforms, temporary files will have a mode of 0o600, and files saved from memory will be saved using the system’s standard umask. As I would understand this text, only temporary files get a mode of 0o600. I would then ask myself: \"Why should I care about temporary files, they should be gone anyway after the file is uploaded?\" and skip setting FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS. What is important but is not properly conveyed to the user is that not only temporary files themselves, but also the actual files which end up in the media folder get permissions of 0o600. Currently a developer can only discover this either by careful reading of the Deployment checklist page (manage.py check --deploy does not seem to check FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS) or by hitting the inconsistent permissions accidentally (like I did). I propose to unify the docs for FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS on the Settings page and the Deployment checklist page like this: ​https://gist.github.com/earshinov/0340f741189a14d4fd10e3e902203ad6/revisions#diff-14151589d5408f8b64b7e0e580770f0e Pros: It makes more clear that one gets different permissions for the *uploaded* files. It makes the docs more unified and thus easier to synchronously change in the future if/when required. I recognize that my edits might seem too minor and insignificant to be worth the hassle of editing the docs, committing, re-publishing them etc., but still I hope you will find them useful enough to be integrated into the official docs.\nNow that I think about, maybe Django could provide # <Commentary about inconsistent permissions when this setting is omitted> FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSINS=0o600 in the ​default project settings so that developers don't miss it? 600 seems a reasonable default, particularly because people would get 600 anyway (at least on some operating systems) when the TemporaryFileUploadHandler is engaged.\nSince this has come up again, I've suggested on django-developers (​https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/h9XbQAPv5-I/discussion) that we adjust the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION default to 0o644 (This was the conclusion I eventually came to from the discussion on #28540.) Lets see what people say there.\nThus far, no great objections on the mailing list to adjusting the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION default. Thus I'm going to rename this and Accept on that basis. A PR would need to: Adjust the default. Add a Breaking Change note to releases/2.2.txt (on the assumption we can get it in for then.) — This should include a set to None to restore previous behaviour' type comment. Adjust the references in the settings docs and deployment checklist. Make sure any other references are adjusted.\nReplying to Carlton Gibson: Thus far, no great objections on the mailing list to adjusting the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION default. Thus I'm going to rename this and Accept on that basis. Thank you! Hopefully, this change will prevent confusion and unpleasant surprises for Django users in the future.\nHello everyone, I would like to work on this. But before that there are few important questions: There is a related setting called FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS. Its document says that This value mirrors the functionality and caveats of the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting. Shall we also change its default from None to 0o644(Please suggest if something different should be provided for directories) and update its document as well? Since 2.2 pre-release branch is now in feature freeze state, Shall we move the change to 3.0 version? On a side note, some tests must be refactored for new values for both of these settings. I think that's alright.\nThat note is referring to that non-leaf directories are created using the process umask. (See ​`makedirs()` docs.) This is similar to FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, when not using the temporary file upload handler. The underlying issue here is the inconsistency in file permissions, depending on the file size, when using the default settings that Django provides. There is no such inconsistency with directory permissions. As such changes should not be needed to FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS. (Any issues there would need to be addressed under a separate ticket.)\nReplying to Carlton Gibson: I see and understand the issue better now. Thanks for the clarification. I'll make the changes as you have suggested in your previous comment. Only question remaining is about introducing this change in 3.0 version. Shall we move it to 3.0 release?\nShall we move it to 3.0 release? Yes please.",

More importantly would be to retain the LOCAL_FILE_DIR setting in the migration. Please look at this ticket: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6896 I think that something like what sandychapman suggested about an extra flag would be cool if the design decision was approved and if there were no restrictions in the implementation for such a change to be made. But that's up to the developers who have had more experience with the project to decide, not me.\nThis seems a reasonable use-case: allow FilePathField to vary path by environment. The trouble with os.path.join(...) is that it will always be interpreted at import time, when the class definition is loaded. (The (...) say, ...and call this....) The way to defer that would be to all path to accept a callable, similarly to how FileField's upload_to takes a callable. It should be enough to evaluate the callable in FilePathField.__init__(). Experimenting with generating a migration looks good. (The operation gives path the fully qualified import path of the specified callable, just as with upload_to.) I'm going to tentatively mark this as Easy Pickings: it should be simple enough.\nReplying to Nicolas Noé: Hi Nicolas, Are you still working on this ticket?\nSorry, I forgot about it. I'll try to solve this real soon (or release the ticket if I can't find time for it).\n​PR\nCan I work on this ticket ?\nSure, sorry for blocking the ticket while I was too busy...\nI think that Nicolas Noe's solution, ​PR, was correct. The model field can accept a callable as it is currently implemented. If you pass it a callable for the path argument it will correctly use that fully qualified function import path in the migration. The problem is when you go to actually instantiate a FilePathField instance, the FilePathField form does some type checking and gives you one of these TypeError: scandir: path should be string, bytes, os.PathLike or None, not function This can be avoided by evaluating the path function first thing in the field form __init__ function, as in the pull request. Then everything seems to work fine.\nHi, If I only change self.path in forms/fields.py, right after __init__ I get this error: File \"/home/hpfn/Documentos/Programacao/python/testes/.venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/forms/fields.py\", line 1106, in __init__ self.choices.append((f, f.replace(path, \"\", 1))) TypeError: replace() argument 1 must be str, not function The 'path' param is used a few lines after. There is one more time. Line 1106 can be wrong. If I put in models/fields/__init__.py - after super(): if callable(self.path): self.path = self.path() I can run 'python manage.py runserver'\nIt can be: if callable(path): path = path() at the beginning of forms/fields.py\n​PR\nAll comments in the original PR (​https://github.com/django/django/pull/10299/commits/7ddb83ca7ed5b2a586e9d4c9e0a79d60b27c26b6) seems to be resolved in the latter one (​https://github.com/django/django/pull/10924/commits/9c3b2c85e46efcf1c916e4b76045d834f16050e3).\nAny hope of this featuring coming through.

        "initialContext": "Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL\nDescription\n\t\nHi.\nThe SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my \"order by\" clause, because he \"thinks\" the clause was already \"seen\" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. \nThe bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nThe sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().\nAs a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nNote: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\\r).\nExample of my query:\n\treturn MyModel.objects.all().order_by(\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).asc(),\n\t\tRawSQL('''\n\t\t\tcase when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')\n\t\t\t\t then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)\n\t\t\t\t else null end''', []).desc())\nThe ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:\n'\t\t\t\t then 2 else 1 end)'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\n'\t\t\t\t else null end'\nSecond RawSQL with a\t\t\t\t else null end part is removed from query.\nThe fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line. \nSo in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases). \nThe bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).\nHope my notes will help you fixing the issue.

Allowing the ordering optimization stuff to handle arbitrary RawSQL may be difficult.\nIs there a reason you can't use ​conditional expressions No, but I didn't knew about the issue, and writing raw sqls is sometimes faster (not in this case ;) I'm really happy having possibility to mix raw sqls with object queries. Next time I'll use expressions, for sure. Allowing the ordering optimization stuff to handle arbitrary RawSQL may be difficult. Personally I'd like to skip RawSQL clauses in the block which is responsible for finding duplicates. If someone is using raw sqls, he knows the best what he is doing, IMO. And it is quite strange if Django removes silently part of your SQL. This is very confusing. And please note that printing a Query instance was generating incomplete sql, but while checking Query.order_by manually, the return value was containing all clauses. I thought that just printing was affected, but our QA dept told me the truth ;) I know there is no effective way to compare similarity of two raw clauses. This may be hard for expression objects, too, but you have a possibility to implement some __eq__ magic (instead of comparation of generated sqls).

Yes, that's not what they should have done, but breaking peoples' projects sucks and I don't really want to do that (even if introducing sorted() might be the least disruptive and at the same time most correct change) wanting to handle the jquery, widget1, noConflict and jquery, widget2, noConflict case has introduced an unexpected amount of complexity introducing a complex solving framework will have a really bad impact on runtime and will introduce even more complexity and is out of the question to me I'm happy to help fixing this but right now I only see bad and worse choices.\nI don't think sorting by length is the way to go - it would be trivial to make the test fail again by extending the first list with unrelated items. It might be a good real-world heuristic for finding a solution more often, but that's just trading a reproducible bug for an unpredictable one. (I'm not sure I'd trust it as a heuristic either: we've encountered this issue on Wagtail CMS, where we're making extensive use of form media on hierarchical form structures, and so those media definitions will tend to bubble up several layers to reach the top level. At that point, there's no way of knowing whether the longer list is the one with more complex dependencies, or just one that collected more unrelated files on the way up the tree...) I'll do some more thinking on this. My hunch is that even if it does end up being a travelling-salesman-type problem, it's unlikely to be run on a large enough data set for performance to be an issue.\nI don't think sorting by length is the way to go - it would be trivial to make the test fail again by extending the first list with unrelated items. It might be a good real-world heuristic for finding a solution more often, but that's just trading a reproducible bug for an unpredictable one. Well yes, if the ColorPicker itself would have a longer list of JS files it depends on then it would fail too. If, on the other hand, it wasn't a ColorPicker widget but a ColorPicker formset or form the initially declared lists would still be preserved and sorting the lists by length would give the correct result. Since #30153 the initially declared lists (or tuples) are preserved so maybe you have many JS and CSS declarations but as long as they are unrelated there will not be many long sublists. I'm obviously happy though if you're willing to spend the time finding a robust solution to this problem. (For the record: Personally I was happy with the state of things pre-2.0 too... and For the record 2: I'm also using custom widgets and inlines in feincms3/django-content-editor. It's really surprising to me that we didn't stumble on this earlier since we're always working on the latest Django version or even on pre-release versions if at all possible)\nHi there, I'm the dude who implemented the warning. I am not so sure this is a bug. Let's try tackle this step by step. The new merging algorithm that was introduced in version 2 is an improvement. It is the most accurate way to merge two sorted lists. It's not the simplest way, but has been reviewed plenty times. The warning is another story. It is independent from the algorithm. It merely tells you that the a certain order could not be maintained. We figured back than, that this would be a good idea. It warns a developer about a potential issue, but does not raise an exception. With that in mind, the correct way to deal with the issue described right now, is to ignore the warning. BUT, that doesn't mean that you don't have a valid point. There are implicit and explicit orders. Not all assets require ordering and (random) orders that only exist because of Media merging don't matter at all. This brings me back to a point that I have [previously made](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30153#comment:6). It would make sense to store the original lists, which is now the case on master, and only raise if the order violates the original list. The current implementation on master could also be improved by removing duplicates. Anyways, I would considers those changes improvements, but not bug fixes. I didn't have time yet to look into this. But I do have some time this weekend. If you want I can take another look into this and propose a solution that solves this issue. Best -Joe\n\"Ignore the warning\" doesn't work here - the order-fixing has broken the dependency between text-editor.js and text-editor-extras.js. I can (reluctantly) accept an implementation that produces false warnings, and I can accept that a genuine dependency loop might produce undefined behaviour, but the combination of the two - breaking the ordering as a result of seeing a loop that isn't there - is definitely a bug. (To be clear, I'm not suggesting that the 2.x implementation is a step backwards from not doing order checking at all - but it does introduce a new failure case, and that's what I'm keen to fix.)\nTo summarise: Even with the new strategy in #30153 of holding on to the un-merged lists as long as possible, the final merging is still done by adding one list at a time. The intermediate results are lists, which are assumed to be order-critical; this means the intermediate results have additional constraints that are not present in the original lists, causing it to see conflicts where there aren't any. Additionally, we should try to preserve the original sequence of files as much as possible, to avoid unnecessarily breaking user code that hasn't fully specified its dependencies and is relying on the 1.x behaviour. I think we need to approach this as a graph problem (which I realise might sound like overkill, but I'd rather start with something formally correct and optimise later as necessary): a conflict occurs whenever the dependency graph is cyclic. #30153 is a useful step towards this, as it ensures we have the accurate dependency graph up until the point where we need to assemble the final list. I suggest we replace Media.merge with a new method that accepts any number of lists (using *args if we want to preserve the existing method signature for backwards compatibility). This would work as follows: Iterate over all items in all sub-lists, building a dependency graph (where a dependency is any item that immediately precedes it within a sub-list) and a de-duplicated list containing all items indexed in the order they are first encountered Starting from the first item in the de-duplicated list, backtrack through the dependency graph, following the lowest-indexed dependency each time until we reach an item with no dependencies. While backtracking, maintain a stack of visited items. If we encounter an item already on the stack, this is a dependency loop; throw a MediaOrderConflictWarning and break out of the backtracking loop Output the resulting item, then remove it from the dependency graph and the de-duplicated list If the 'visited items' stack is non-empty, pop the last item off it and repeat the backtracking step from there. Otherwise, repeat the backtracking step starting from the next item in the de-duplicated list Repeat until no items remain\nThis sounds correct. I'm not sure it's right though. It does sound awfully complex for what there is to gain. Maintaining this down the road will not get easier. Finding, explaining and understanding the fix for #30153 did already cost a lot of time which could also have been invested elsewhere. If I manually assign widget3's JS lists (see https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30179#comment:5) then everything just works and the final result is correct: # widget3 = Media(js=['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']) widget3 = Media() widget3._js_lists = [['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js'], ['color-picker.js']] So what you proposed first (https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30179#comment:1) might just work fine and would be good enough (tm). Something like ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/543fc97407a932613d283c1e0bb47616cf8782e3/django/forms/widgets.py#L52 # Instead of self._js_lists = [js]: self._js_lists = list(js) if isinstance(js, set) else [js]\n@Matthias: I think that solution will work, but only if: 1) we're going to insist that users always use this notation wherever a \"non-dependency\" exists - i.e. it is considered user error for the user to forget to put color-picker.js in its own sub-list 2) we have a very tight definition of what a dependency is - e.g. color-picker.js can't legally be a dependency of text-editor.js / text-editor-extras.js, because it exists on its own in ColorPicker's media - which also invalidates the [jquery, widget1, noconflict] + [jquery, widget2, noconflict] case (does noconflict depend on widget1 or not?) I suspect you only have to go slightly before the complexity of [jquery, widget1, noconflict] + [jquery, widget2, noconflict] before you start running into counter-examples again.\nPR: ​https://github.com/django/django/pull/11010 I encountered another subtle bug along the way (which I suspect has existed since 1.x): #12879 calls for us to strip duplicates from the input lists, but in the current implementation the only de-duplication happens during Media.merge, so this never happens in the case of a single list. I've now extended the tests to cover this: ​https://github.com/django/django/pull/11010/files#diff-7fc04ae9019782c1884a0e97e96eda1eR154 . As a minor side effect of this extra de-duplication step, tuples get converted to lists more often, so I've had to fix up some existing tests accordingly - hopefully that's acceptable fall-out :-)\nMatt, great work. I believe it is best to merge all lists at once and not sequentially as I did. Based on your work, I would suggest to simply use the algorithms implemented in Python. Therefore the whole merge function can be replaced with a simple one liner: import heapq from collections import OrderedDict def merge(*sublists): return list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(heapq.merge(*sublists))) # >>> merge([3],[1],[1,2],[2,3]) # [1, 2, 3]\nIt actually behaves different. I will continue to review your pull-request. As stated there, it would be helpful if there is some kind of resource to understand what strategy you implemented. For now I will try to review it without it.",

If a Permission exists already with the new content_type and permission name, IntegrityError is raised since it violates the unique_key constraint on permission model i.e. content_type_id_code_name\nTo get into the situation where you already have permissions with the content type you should be able to do the following: Start on Django <2.2 Create a model called 'TestModel' Migrate Delete the model called 'TestModel' Add a new proxy model called 'TestModel' Migrate Update to Django >=2.2 Migrate We think this is what happened in our case where we found this issue (​https://sentry.thalia.nu/share/issue/68be0f8c32764dec97855b3cbb3d8b55/). We have a proxy model with the same name that a previous non-proxy model once had. This changed during a refactor and the permissions + content type for the original model still exist. Our solution will probably be removing the existing permissions from the table, but that's really only a workaround.\nReproduced with steps from comment. It's probably regression in 181fb60159e54d442d3610f4afba6f066a6dac05.\nWhat happens when creating a regular model, deleting it and creating a new proxy model: Create model 'RegularThenProxyModel' +----------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+ | name | codename | model | +----------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+ | Can add regular then proxy model | add_regularthenproxymodel | regularthenproxymodel | +----------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+ Migrate Delete the model called 'RegularThenProxyModel' Add a new proxy model called 'RegularThenProxyModel' +----------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+ | name | codename | model | +----------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+ | Can add concrete model | add_concretemodel | concretemodel | | Can add regular then proxy model | add_regularthenproxymodel | concretemodel | | Can add regular then proxy model | add_regularthenproxymodel | regularthenproxymodel | +----------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+ What happens when creating a proxy model right away: Create a proxy model 'RegularThenProxyModel' +----------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------+ | name | codename | model | +----------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------+ | Can add concrete model | add_concretemodel | concretemodel | | Can add regular then proxy model | add_regularthenproxymodel | concretemodel | +----------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------+ As you can see, the problem here is that permissions are not cleaned up, so we are left with an existing | Can add regular then proxy model | add_regularthenproxymodel | regularthenproxymodel | row. When the 2.2 migration is applied, it tries to create that exact same row, hence the IntegrityError. Unfortunately, there is no remove_stale_permission management command like the one for ContentType. So I think we can do one of the following: Show a nice error message to let the user delete the conflicting migration OR Re-use the existing permission I think 1. is much safer as it will force users to use a new permission and assign it accordingly to users/groups. Edit: I revised my initial comment after reproducing the error in my environment.\nIt's also possible to get this kind of integrity error on the auth.0011 migration if another app is migrated first causing the auth post_migrations hook to run. The auth post migrations hook runs django.contrib.auth.management.create_permissions, which writes the new form of the auth_permission records to the table. Then when the auth.0011 migration runs it tries to update things to the values that were just written. To reproduce this behavior: pip install Django==2.1.7 Create an app, let's call it app, with two models, TestModel(models.Model) and ProxyModel(TestModel) the second one with proxy=True python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate pip install Django==2.2 Add another model to app python manage.py makemigrations migrate the app only, python manage.py migrate app. This does not run the auth migrations, but does run the auth post_migrations hook Note that new records have been added to auth_permission python manage.py migrate, this causes an integrity error when the auth.0011 migration tries to update records that are the same as the ones already added in step 8. This has the same exception as this bug report, I don't know if it's considered a different bug, or the same one.\nYes it is the same issue. My recommendation to let the users figure it out with a helpful message still stands even if it may sound a bit painful, because: It prevents data loss (we don't do an automatic delete/create of permissions) It prevents security oversights (we don't re-use an existing permission) It shouldn't happen for most use cases Again, I would love to hear some feedback or other alternatives.\nI won’t have time to work on this for the next 2 weeks so I’m de-assigning myself. I’ll pick it up again if nobody does and I’m available to discuss feedback/suggestions.\nI'll make a patch for this. I'll see about raising a suitable warning from the migration but we already warn in the release notes for this to audit permissions: my initial thought was that re-using the permission would be OK. (I see Arthur's comment. Other thoughts?)\nBeing my first contribution I wanted to be super (super) careful with security concerns, but given the existing warning in the release notes for auditing prior to update, I agree that re-using the permission feels pretty safe and would remove overhead for people running into this scenario. Thanks for taking this on Carlton, I'd be happy to review.",

I'm not sure I remember any specific manage.py handling in the old implementation, so I'm not sure how it used to work, but I should be able to fix this pretty easily.\nDone a touch of debugging: iter_modules_and_files is where it gets lost. Specifically, it ends up in there twice: (<module '__future__' from '/../lib/python3.6/__future__.py'>, <module '__main__' from 'manage.py'>, <module '__main__' from 'manage.py'>, ...,) But getattr(module, \"__spec__\", None) is None is True so it continues onwards. I thought I managed to get one of them to have a __spec__ attr but no has_location, but I can't seem to get that again (stepping around with pdb) Digging into wtf __spec__ is None: ​Here's the py3 docs on it, which helpfully mentions that ​The one exception is __main__, where __spec__ is set to None in some cases\nTom, will you have time to work on this in the next few days?\nI'm sorry for assigning it to myself Mariusz, I intended to work on it on Tuesday but work overtook me and now I am travelling for a wedding this weekend. So I doubt it I'm afraid. It seems Keryn's debugging is a great help, it should be somewhat simple to add special case handling for __main__, while __spec__ is None we can still get the filename and watch on that.\nnp, Tom, thanks for info. Keryn, it looks that you've already made most of the work. Would you like to prepare a patch?",

When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.\nThis problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.\nThis can be easily added into default Django static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:\ndef render(self, context):\n\turl = self.url(context)\n\t# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME'] \n\tif self.varname is None:\n\t\treturn url\n\tcontext[self.varname] = url\n\t\treturn ''\nOn more research I found that FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage ignores SCRIPT_NAME as well. \nWe might have to do a lot of changes but I think it's worth the efforts.\n",

            "hints_text": "This change doesn't seem correct to me (for one, it seems like it could break existing sites). Why not include the appropriate prefix in your STATIC_URL and MEDIA_URL settings?\nThis is not a patch. This is just an idea I got about the patch for {% static %} only. The patch will (probably) involve FileSystemStorage and StaticFileSystemStorage classes. The main idea behind this feature was that Django will auto detect script_name header and use that accordingly for creating static and media urls. This will reduce human efforts for setting up sites in future. This patch will also take time to develop so it can be added in Django2.0 timeline.\nWhat I meant was that I don't think Django should automatically use SCRIPT_NAME in generating those URLs. If you're running your site on a subpath, then you should set your STATIC_URL to '​http://example.com/subpath/static/' or whatever. However, you might not even be hosting static and uploaded files on the same domain as your site (in fact, for user-uploaded files, you shouldn't do that ​for security reasons) in which case SCRIPT_URL is irrelevant in constructing the static/media URLs. How would the change make it easier to setup sites?\nI think that the idea basically makes sense. Ideally, a Django instance shouldn't need to know at which subpath it is being deployed, as this can be considered as purely sysadmin stuff. It would be a good separation of concerns. For example, the Web administrator may change the WSGIScriptAlias from /foo to /bar and the application should continue working. Of course, this only applies when *_URL settings are not full URIs. In practice, it's very likely that many running instances are adapting their *_URL settings to include the base script path, hence the behavior change would be backwards incompatible. The question is whether the change is worth the incompatibility.\nI see. I guess the idea would be to use get_script_prefix() like reverse() does as I don't think we have access to request everywhere we need it. It seems like some public APIs like get_static_url() and get_media_url() would replace accessing the settings directly whenever building URLs. For backwards compatibility, possibly these functions could try to detect if the setting is already prefixed appropriately. Removing the prefix from the settings, however, means that the URLs are no longer correct when generated outside of a request/response cycle though (#16734). I'm not sure if it might create any practical problems, but we might think about addressing that issue first.\nI'm here at DjangoCon US 2016 will try to create a patch for this ticket ;) Why? But before I make the patch, here are some reasons to do it. The first reason is consistency inside Django core: {% url '...' %} template tag does respect SCRIPT_NAME but {% static '...' %} does not reverse(...) function does respect SCRIPT_NAME but static(...) does not And the second reason is that there is no way to make it work in case when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value - see an example below. Of course we shouldn't modify STATIC_URL when it's an absolute URL, with domain & protocol. But if it starts with / - it's relative to our Django project and we need to add SCRIPT_NAME prefix. Real life example You have Django running via WSGI behind reverse proxy (let's call it back-end server), and another HTTP server on the front (let's call it front-end server). Front-end server URL is http://some.domain.com/sub/path/, back-end server URL is http://1.2.3.4:5678/. You want them both to work. You pass SCRIPT_NAME = '/sub/path/' from front-end server to back-end one. But when you access back-end server directly - there is no SCRIPT_NAME passed to WSGI/Django. So we cannot hard-code SCRIPT_NAME in Django settings because it's dynamic.\nPull-request created: ​https://github.com/django/django/pull/7000\nAt least documentation and additional tests look like they are required.\nAbsolutely agree with your remarks, Tim. I'll add tests. Could you point to docs that need to be updated?\nI would like to take this ticket on and have a new PR for it: ​https://github.com/django/django/pull/10724",

I chose to use resolve() to try and work around a corner case with symlinks, and to generally just normalize the paths to prevent duplication. Also, regarding your comment above, you would need to use print(repr(path)), as I think the print machinery stops at the first null byte found (hence just /Users, which should never be monitored by itself).

That's exactly what In.process_rhs ​does already by only performing these operations if not getattr(self.rhs, 'has_select_fields', True).\nThanks so much for the help Simon! This is a great jumping-off point. There's something that I'm unclear about, which perhaps you can shed some light on. While I was able to replicate the bug with 2.2, when I try to create a test on Master to validate the bug, the group-by behavior seems to have changed. Here's the test that I created: def test_exact_selected_field_rhs_subquery(self): author_1 = Author.objects.create(name='one') author_2 = Author.objects.create(name='two') max_ids = Author.objects.filter(alias__isnull=True).values('alias').annotate(m=Max('id')).values('m') authors = Author.objects.filter(id=max_ids[:1]) self.assertFalse(str(max_ids.query)) # This was just to force the test-runner to output the query. self.assertEqual(authors[0], author_2) And here's the resulting query: SELECT MAX(\"lookup_author\".\"id\") AS \"m\" FROM \"lookup_author\" WHERE \"lookup_author\".\"alias\" IS NULL GROUP BY \"lookup_author\".\"alias\", \"lookup_author\".\"name\" It no longer appears to be grouping by the 'alias' field listed in the initial .values() preceeding the .annotate(). I looked at the docs and release notes to see if there was a behavior change, but didn't see anything listed. Do you know if I'm just misunderstanding what's happening here? Or does this seem like a possible regression?\nIt's possible that a regression was introduced in between. Could you try bisecting the commit that changed the behavior ​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/triaging-tickets/#bisecting-a-regression\nMmm actually disregard that. The second value in the GROUP BY is due to the ordering value in the Author class's Meta class. class Author(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=100) alias = models.CharField(max_length=50, null=True, blank=True) class Meta: ordering = ('name',) Regarding the bug in question in this ticket, what should the desired behavior be if the inner query is returning multiple fields? With the fix, which allows the inner query to define a field to return/group by, if there are multiple fields used then it will throw a sqlite3.OperationalError: row value misused. Is this the desired behavior or should it avoid this problem by defaulting back to pk if more than one field is selected?\nI think that we should only default to pk if no fields are selected. The ORM has preliminary support for multi-column lookups and other interface dealing with subqueries doesn't prevent passing queries with multiple fields so I'd stick to the current __in lookup behavior.",

You can always call bool() on a right hand side. Sorry for my previous acceptation (I shouldn't triage tickets in the weekend). I understand your point. But is there anything we can do to avoid people falling for the same pitfall I did? The problem, in my opinion, is that it works fine for simple queries but as soon as you add a join that needs promotion it will break, silently. Maybe we should make it raise an exception when a non-boolean is passed? One valid example is to have a class that implements __bool__. You can see here ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/d9881a025c15d87b2a7883ee50771117450ea90d/django/db/models/lookups.py#L465-L470 that non-bool value is converted to IS NULL and IS NOT NULL already using the truthy/falsy values. IMO it would be confusing if we'll allow for truthy/falsy values, e.g. take a look at these examples fieldisnull='false' or fieldisnull='true' (both would return the same result).

It just is inconsistent, in lookups.py field__isnull='false' will be a positive condition but on the query.py it will be the negative condition.\nMaybe adding a note on the documentation? something like: \"Although it might seem like it will work with non-bool fields, this is not supported and can lead to inconsistent behaviours\"\nAgreed, we should raise an error for non-boolean values, e.g. diff --git a/django/db/models/lookups.py b/django/db/models/lookups.py index 9344979c56..fc4a38c4fe 100644 --- a/django/db/models/lookups.py +++ b/django/db/models/lookups.py @@ -463,6 +463,11 @@ class IsNull(BuiltinLookup): prepare_rhs = False def as_sql(self, compiler, connection): + if not isinstance(self.rhs, bool): + raise ValueError( + 'The QuerySet value for an isnull lookup must be True or ' + 'False.' + ) sql, params = compiler.compile(self.lhs) if self.rhs: return \"%s IS NULL\" % sql, params I changed the ticket description.\nThanks, I'll work on it!

So on Django 2.1 and Python 3.7: In [1]: import django ...: django.VERSION In [2]: from django.db import models ...: ...: class FooBar(models.Model): ...: def get_foo_bar_display(self): ...: return \"something\" ...: ...: foo_bar = models.CharField(\"foo\", choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')]) ...: ...: def __str__(self): ...: return self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1 ...: ...: class Meta: ...: app_label = 'test' ...: ...: FooBar(foo_bar=1) Out[2]: <FooBar: foo> Before ​Python 3.6 the order of attrs wasn't defined at all.\nSergey, an example from the ticket description works for me with Django 2.1 and Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.\nIn [2]: import django ...: django.VERSION Out[2]: (2, 1, 13, 'final', 0) In [3]: import sys ...: sys.version Out[3]: '3.5.7 (default, Oct 17 2019, 07:04:41) \\n[GCC 8.3.0]' In [4]: from django.db import models ...: ...: class FooBar(models.Model): ...: foo_bar = models.CharField(\"foo\", choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')]) ...: ...: def __str__(self): ...: return self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1 ...: ...: def get_foo_bar_display(self): ...: return \"something\" ...: ...: class Meta: ...: app_label = 'test' ...: ...: FooBar(foo_bar=1) Out[4]: <FooBar: foo>\nOK, so there is a behaviour change here, but Sergey is correct that it does depend on attr order, so it's hard to say that this can be said to ever have been thought of as supported, with the exact example provided. This example produces the opposite result on 2.1 (even on >=PY36): def test_overriding_display_backwards(self): class FooBar2(models.Model): def get_foo_bar_display(self): return \"something\" foo_bar = models.CharField(\"foo\", choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')]) f = FooBar2(foo_bar=1) # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in both 2.2 and 2.1 self.assertEqual(f.get_foo_bar_display(), \"foo\") Because get_foo_bar_display() is defined before foo_bar is gets replaced in the the add_to_class() step. Semantically order shouldn't make a difference. Given that it does, I can't see that we're bound to maintain that behaviour. (There's a possible fix in Field.contribute_to_class() but implementing that just reverses the pass/fail behaviour depending on order...) Rather, the correct way to implement this on 2.2+ is: def test_overriding_display(self): class FooBar(models.Model): foo_bar = models.CharField(\"foo\", choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')]) def _get_FIELD_display(self, field): if field.attname == 'foo_bar': return \"something\" return super()._get_FIELD_display(field) f = FooBar(foo_bar=1) self.assertEqual(f.get_foo_bar_display(), \"something\") This is stable for declaration order on version 2.2+. This approach requires overriding _get_FIELD_display() before declaring fields on 2.1, because otherwise Model._get_FIELD_display() is picked up during Field.contribute_to_class(). This ordering dependency is, ultimately, the same issue that was addressed in a68ea231012434b522ce45c513d84add516afa60, and the follow-up in #30254. The behaviour in 2.1 (and before) was incorrect. Yes, there's a behaviour change here but it's a bugfix, and all bugfixes are breaking changes if you're depending on the broken behaviour. I'm going to downgrade this from Release Blocker accordingly. I'll reclassify this as a Documentation issue and provide the working example, as overriding _get_FIELD_display() is a legitimate use-case I'd guess.\nReplying to Carlton Gibson: (There's a possible fix in Field.contribute_to_class() but implementing that just reverses the pass/fail behaviour depending on order...) Doesn't this fix it? if not hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name): setattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name, partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self))",

Thanks\n​https://github.com/django/django/pull/12266\nI think this ticket is very much related to the discussions on #30931. The line if not hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name) breaks the expected behaviour on model inheritance, which causing this bug. (see ​https://github.com/django/django/commit/2d38eb0ab9f78d68c083a5b78b1eca39027b279a#diff-bf776a3b8e5dbfac2432015825ef8afeR766) IMO there are three important points to discuss: 1- Obviously get_<field>_display() should work as expected with inheritance, so this line should be reverted/fixed: if not hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name) 2- I think developers should be able to override get_<field>_display() method on the model class: class Bar(models.Model): foo = models.CharField('foo', choices=[(0, 'foo')]) def get_foo_display(self): return 'something' b = Bar(foo=0) assert b.get_foo_display() == 'something' 3- I think Field should not check an attribute of model class and make a decision based on it. This check and set logic should be delegated to BaseModel with an abstraction to make it less magical and more clean. Maybe something like this: class ModelBase(type): .... def add_overridable_to_class(cls, name, value): // Set value only if the name is not already defined in the class itself (no `hasattr`) if name not in cls.__dict__: setattr(cls, name, value) class Field(RegisterLookupMixin): ... def contribute_to_class(self, cls, name, private_only=False): ... if self.choices is not None: cls.add_overridable_to_class('get_%s_display' % self.name, partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self))\nWhy would checking on fields class be a bad idea? If you are a field of a model that is not abstract but your parent is an abstract method, wouldn't you want to override your parent's method if you both have the same method?\nReplying to George Popides: Why would checking on fields class be a bad idea? If you are a field of a model that is not abstract but your parent is an abstract method, wouldn't you want to override your parent's method if you both have the same method? Well it is not something I would prefer because it makes two classes tightly coupled to each other, which means it is hard to change one without touching to the other one and you always need to think about side effects of your change. Which eventually makes this two classes hard to test and makes the codebase hard to maintain. Your logic about overriding might/or might not be true. I would just execute this logic on ModelBase rather than Field.",

        "initialContext": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers ​rollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n",

The original report still seems accurate to me, with the proposed solution valid. I've been working on a fix and (most of the work), testcase for this problem. I'll do some more testing and provide a proper PR for this issue and #31051 soon. The testcase is not ideal yet (testing the testing framework is tricky), but I'll expand on that in the PR. Furthermore, I noticed that loaddata does not just wrap everything in a transaction, it also explicitly disables constraint checks inside the transaction: with connection.constraint_checks_disabled(): self.objs_with_deferred_fields = [] for fixture_label in fixture_labels: self.load_label(fixture_label) for obj in self.objs_with_deferred_fields: obj.save_deferred_fields(using=self.using) # Since we disabled constraint checks, we must manually check for # any invalid keys that might have been added table_names = [model._meta.db_table for model in self.models] try: connection.check_constraints(table_names=table_names) except Exception as e: e.args = (\"Problem installing fixtures: %s\" % e,) raise I had a closer look at how this works (since I understood that a transaction already implicitly disables constraint checks) and it turns out that MySQL/InnoDB is an exception and does *not* defer constraint checks to the end of the transaction, but instead needs extra handling (so constraint_checks_disabled() is a no-op on most database backends).

How can we find the involved tables columns? Thanks\nHasan this is another kind of collision, these fields are not selected and part of join tables so they won't be part of names.

        "initialContext": "Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n",

Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests.

For example the models of the accounts app are here: ​https://github.com/speedy-net/speedy-net/blob/master/speedy/core/accounts/models.py (Search for \"class Entity\" and \"class User\". The id = SmallUDIDField() field in class Entity is the primary key. It also works for getting a User model by User.objects.get(pk=...). Also same is for class ReservedUsername above, which is a much more simpler model than class User. The definition of SmallUDIDField above (the primary key field) is on ​https://github.com/speedy-net/speedy-net/blob/master/speedy/core/base/fields.py .\nThanks for the report.

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\") loads all the fields with the following query: SELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\" This is an expected behavior, defer() removes fields from the list of fields specified by the only() method (i.e. list of fields that should not be deferred). In this example only() adds name to the list, defer() removes name from the list, so you have empty lists and all fields will be loaded. It is also ​documented: # Final result is that everything except \"headline\" is deferred. Entry.objects.only(\"headline\", \"body\").defer(\"body\") Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\") also loads all the fields with the same query: SELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\" I agree you shouldn't get all field, but only pk, name, and trade_number: SELECT \"ticket_32704_company\".\"id\", \"ticket_32704_company\".\"name\", \"ticket_32704_company\".\"trade_number\" FROM \"ticket_32704_company\" this is due to the fact that defer() doesn't clear the list of deferred field when chaining with only(). I attached a proposed patch.\nDraft.\nAfter reading the documentation carefully, i cannot say that it is clearly stated that deferring all the fields used in a previous .only() call performs a reset of the deferred set. Moreover, in the .defer() ​section, we have: You can make multiple calls to defer(). Each call adds new fields to the deferred set: and this seems to suggest that: calls to .defer() cannot remove items from the deferred set and evaluating qs.defer(\"some_field\") should never fetch the column \"some_field\" (since this should add \"some_field\" to the deferred set) the querysets qs.defer(\"field1\").defer(\"field2\") and qs.defer(\"field1\", \"field2\") should be equivalent IMHO, there is a mismatch between the doc and the actual implementation.\ncalls to .defer() cannot remove items from the deferred set and evaluating qs.defer(\"some_field\") should never fetch the column \"some_field\" (since this should add \"some_field\" to the deferred set) Feel-free to propose a docs clarification (see also #24048). the querysets qs.defer(\"field1\").defer(\"field2\") and qs.defer(\"field1\", \"field2\") should be equivalent That's why I accepted Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\") as a bug.\nI think that what is described in the documentation is what users are expected and it is the implementation that should be fixed! With your patch proposal, i do not think that: Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\") is equivalent to Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\", \"country\")\nReplying to Manuel Baclet: I think that what is described in the documentation is what users are expected and it is the implementation that should be fixed! I don't agree, and there is no need to shout. As documented: \"The only() method is more or less the opposite of defer(). You call it with the fields that should not be deferred ...\", so .only('name').defer('name') should return all fields. You can start a discussion on DevelopersMailingList if you don't agree. With your patch proposal, i do not think that: Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\") is equivalent to Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\", \"country\") Did you check this? with proposed patch country is the only deferred fields in both cases. As far as I'm aware that's an intended behavior.\nWith the proposed patch, I think that: Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\", \"country\") loads all fields whereas: Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\") loads all fields except \"country\". Why is that? In the first case: existing.difference(field_names) == {\"name\"}.difference([\"name\", \"country\"]) == empty_set and we go into the if branch clearing all the deferred fields and we are done. In the second case: existing.difference(field_names) == {\"name\"}.difference([\"name\"]) == empty_set and we go into the if branch clearing all the deferred fields. Then we add \"country\" to the set of deferred fields.\nHey all, Replying to Mariusz Felisiak: Replying to Manuel Baclet: With your patch proposal, i do not think that: Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\") is equivalent to Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\", \"country\") Did you check this? with proposed patch country is the only deferred fields in both cases. As far as I'm aware that's an intended behavior. I believe Manuel is right. This happens because the set difference in one direction gives you the empty set that will clear out the deferred fields - but it is missing the fact that we might also be adding more defer fields than we had only fields in the first place, so that we actually switch from an .only() to a .defer() mode. See the corresponding PR that should fix this behaviour ​https://github.com/django/django/pull/14667",

This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable?

        "initialContext": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

            "hints_text": "I don't think you've implemented your router correctly, but I'd need to check the router code to see if it's called multiple times (num_dbs*num_models) to be sure. This is how we implement our routers for allow_migrate: def allow_migrate(self, db, model): if db == 'other': return model._meta.app_label == 'legacy_app' # allow migration for new django models implemented in legacy db elif model._meta.app_label == 'legacy_app': # do not allow migration for legacy on any other db return False return None # this router not responsible So, I'm not sure if there is a bug or not (I'll let someone more familiar answer that), but this is what works for us.\n#22583 is somewhat related. It deals with the inability to skip RunSQL/RunPython operations on given database.\n@jarshwah: I don't think it is the router. Mainly because the router is not called at this point. Which is what I believe is the bug. @akaariai: I agree that there are similarities. Surely I should be able to manage which connections I actually run migrations against. That seems to be what the db_router is trying to do. I thought that something like the following would solve our problem: from django.db import router . . . def ensure_schema(self): \"\"\" Ensures the table exists and has the correct schema. \"\"\" # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema # in the codebase. if self.Migration._meta.db_table in self.connection.introspection.get_table_list(self.connection.cursor()): return # Make the table # Change below, similar to how allowed_to_migrate in django/db/migrations/operations/base.py works if router.allow_migrate(self.connection, self.Migration): with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor: editor.create_model(self.Migration) But this means that changes to applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied need to be made, so that it doesn't try to write to a none existent table. For us this is not an urgent issue, as we have appropriate permissions to those connections that are not our core connection. But I do have a concern for any time that we are using a true read-only connection, where we do not have the CREATE TABLE permission. Because this code, as it exists, will blow up in this situation. I tested that with a read-only connection in our db setup, and got an insufficient permissions error. Thanks, Dylan\nThis is an issue, but bear in mind that migrate must be separately executed for each database alias, so this isn't going to happen unless you specifically run migrate on a database that you know isn't supposed to have migrations on it. I think the best fix would be to have migrations refuse to run entirely and just exit if the migration model is not allowed to be created on the target database.\nI see what you mean about the needing to run migarte for each database. I noticed this with the django test runner, where it is trying to run a migration against every connection alias that we have. So that might be an issue with the test runner as much as with the migrations stuff. Thanks, Dylan\nJust stumbled on this issue. With a properly written router, I expected the migrations of each app to be executed in the right database by just using : manage.py migrate Could this be the behavior ? Instead it's assuming I'm using the default database, OK, no, but ok :-)... and it doesn't follow the allow_migrate rule and creates in the default database the tables that are supposed to live exclusively in the another one (NOT OK !). So for now the workaround for me is to use a shell script where the app and the database are specified.: ./manage.py migrate inapppurchase --database=iap ./manage.py migrate myapp --database=default\ndperetti: Just like syncdb, migrate only runs on one database at a time, so you must execute it individually for each database, as you suggest. This is by design. froomzy: Yes, this is likely a test runner issue, that would be doing this kind of migrate-on-everything. I think the suggested fix of refusing to migrate databases where allow_migrate on the migration model returns False will still work, as long as it errors in a way we can catch in the test runner.\nReplying to andrewgodwin: dperetti: Just like syncdb, migrate only runs on one database at a time, so you must execute it individually for each database, as you suggest. This is by design. The question is : is it the best design ? When I run migrate, I don't want to know about how the router is configured. I just want to migrate the app. If the router dispatches the tables of an app to different databases, then I want migrate to operate on those. In other words, I think it would make sense to make migrate database agnostic.\nAnother side issue : we cannot just manage.py migrate someapp if the someapp is a \"django <1.7\" app without migration : the old syncdb behavior is not applied when an application is specified. So if want the old apps to sync, I have to just run manage.py migrate, without argument... which will create unwanted tables when we have multiple databases.\nHi guys, Just wondering if there is any chance this will make it into 1.8? Or soon there after? Thanks, Dylan\nIt's not clear to me what fixing this issue involves exactly. Anyway, it doesn't appear anyone is working on it so there's no timetable for its resolution.\nI wanted to chime in here to broaden the scope of the bug, as I was affected by it recently in a different context. The bigger issue is not just that the framework tries to create the migrations table where it's not needed, but that it marks as applied migrations that in fact were not. That puts the database in an inconsistent state, at least as far as migrations are concerned. It's a harmless inconsistency for the specific settings file used at that specific moment in time, but it lays the seed for big problems down the line. For example, if you later decide to change your routing scheme, or (as happened in my case) if you have multiple projects with different settings using the same app on the same database. In terms of a solution, what seems straightforward to my untrained eye is for the migration framework to simply not record migrations as applied that it didn't apply (and as a corollary, it shouldn't try to create the migration table on a database if it doesn't need to record any migrations there). The fix suggested above (\"to have migrations refuse to run entirely and just exit if the migration model is not allowed to be created on the target database\") doesn't address the broader issue.\nLet me amend my last comment: I think that having migrate blow up in this situation would in fact solve the problem with having an inconsistent migrations table, which is the most important thing. My question is, since allow_migrate() operates at the model level and the migrate command operates at the app level, wouldn't this make it impossible to migrate some models of an app but not others?\nI can confirm marfire's findings. 1/ For example even with this router applied: class testerouter(object): def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints): return False And then executing: migrate --database=replica All apps and models migrations get applied to this replica database, while according to the router nothing should happen at all. 2/ From the documentation it is not clear whether it is possible to isolate certain models from certain databases, or whether isolation can only be done on the app-level. From the description in the documentation, it seems possible to use the model_name argument for this, but by the way django stores its migrations, I don't see how that could work.\nJust to further confirm: I've been wrestling with this problem for a couple days. I have multiple databases and multiple apps. When I'm running tests, the router allow_migrate works properly to control which migrations can be applied to which database/app. The actual migration portion works fine, but when it comes time to actually write the migration history, it seems to only have a concept of the default database. When it runs ensure_schema, it's expecting that tables should exist on the default DB when they really only exist for certain other apps/databases. This leads to a ProgrammingError where it can't find tables that it shouldn't be checking for in the first place.\nCan you please have a look at ​http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40893868/using-redshift-as-an-additional-django-database?noredirect=1#comment69004673_40893868, which provides a decent use case for this bug.\nSince 3.1 you can set 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} to avoid running migrations on a given db connection, so that solves the test runner issue. Still, even if you do that, apps are still synced (see fix to #32012), Django ends up calling migrate to do the syncing, and this will cause queries in MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema() that might create tables (or fail with permission errors, see #27141). I plan to open a PR to do roughly this from comment:13: it shouldn't try to create the migration table on a database if it doesn't need to record any migrations there",

Adding BASE_DIR to the list of template directories causes the entire project directory to be marked as a template directory, and Django does not watch for changes in template directories by design.\nI think I encountered this recently while making examples for #33461, though I didn't get fully to the bottom of what was going on. Django does not watch for changes in template directories by design. It does, via the template_changed signal listener, which from my brief poking around when I saw it, is I believe the one which prevented trigger_reload from executing. But that mostly led to my realising I don't know what function is responsible for reloading for python files, rather than template/i18n files, so I moved on. I would tentatively accept this, personally.\nReplying to Keryn Knight: Django does not watch for changes in template directories by design. It does, via the template_changed signal listener My bad, I meant that Django does not watch for changes in template directories to reload the server. The template_changed signal listener returns True if the change occurs in a file located in a designated template directory, which causes notify_file_changed to not trigger the reload. AFAIK from browsing the code, for a python file (or actually any file not in a template directory), the template_changed signal listener returns None, which causes notify_file_changed to trigger the reload, right? So could we fix this by checking if the changed file is a python file inside the template_changed signal listener, regardless of whether it is in a template directory? def template_changed(sender, file_path, **kwargs): if file_path.suffix == '.py': return # Now check if the file was a template file This seems to work on a test project, but I have not checked for side effects, although I don't think there should be any.\nI would tentatively accept this, personally. 😀 I was thinking I'd tentatively wontfix, as not worth the complication — but let's accept for review and see what the consensus is.

Yes, but it's a different issue, strictly related with Permission and its content_type. get_content_type() is trying to find a content type using obj._state.db so when we create a Permission() without ._state.db it will first try to find a content type in the default db.

Okay, I understand the issue now, thanks for the details!! First thing, it makes me wonder why we require to have a DB attribute set, at a moment where we are not (yet) interacting with the DB. So we are currently checking, when setting the content_type FK, that the router allows this relation. I guess one option is to not do that for not-saved model instances. Would it make sense to defer this to when we start interacting with the DB? But it brings a whole other lot of changes and challenges, like changing a deep behaviour of FKs and multi-tenancy :/ Apart from that, if we don't want to set directly the internal attribute _state.db, I guess we would need a proper way to pass the db/using to the model instantiation. What would be the most Django-y way? Passing it through the model constructor => this has quite a large impact, as a keyword argument would possibly shadow existing field names: Permission(..., db=using). Quite risky in terms of backward compatibility I guess. Adding a method to Model? Something like: Permission(...).using(db), which could perhaps then be re-used in other places also. (EDIT: which wouldn't work, as the setting the FK happens before setting the DB alias.) What do you think ? :) Or am I missing other solutions?\nApart from that, if we don't want to set directly the internal attribute _state.db, I guess we would need a proper way to pass the db/using to the model instantiation. _state is ​documented so using it is not so bad.

Quite risky in terms of backward compatibility I guess. Adding a method to Model? Something like: Permission(...).using(db), which could perhaps then be re-used in other places also. What do you think ? :) Or am I missing other solutions? Django doesn't support cross-db relationships and users were always responsible for assigning related objects from the same db. I don't think that we should add more logic to do this. The Permission-content_type issue is really an edge case in managing relations, as for me we don't need a generic solution for it.",

This means that the poly object created by `axhspan` is not as large as the rest of the code expects. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/11737d0694109f71d2603ba67d764aa2fb302761/lib/matplotlib/widgets.py#L722\r\n\r\nA quick workaround is to have the valinit contain two different numbers (even if only minuscule difference)\nYes you are right!\r\nThanks a lot for digging into this!!\nCompare:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\r\npoly_same_valinit = ax.axvspan(0, 0, 0, 1)\r\npoly_diff_valinit = ax.axvspan(0, .5, 0, 1)\r\nprint(poly_same_valinit.xy.shape)\r\nprint(poly_diff_valinit.xy.shape)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich gives:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(4, 2)\r\n(5, 2)\r\n```\r\n\nTwo solutions spring to mind:\r\n\r\n1. Easier option\r\nThrow an error in init if `valinit[0] == valinit[1]`\r\n\r\n2. Maybe better option?\r\nDon't use axhspan and manually create the poly to ensure it always has the expected number of vertices\nOption 2 might be better yes\n@vpicouet any interest in opening a PR?\nI don't think I am qualified to do so, never opened a PR yet. \r\nRangeSlider might also contain another issue. \r\nWhen I call `RangeSlider.set_val([0.0,0.1])`\r\nIt changes only the blue poly object and the range value on the right side of the slider not the dot:\r\n![Capture d’écran, le 2022-03-25 à 15 53 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37241971/160191943-aef5fbe2-2f54-42ae-9719-23375767b212.jpg)\r\n \n> I don't think I am qualified to do so, never opened a PR yet.\r\n\r\nThat's always true until you've opened your first one :).

I might try when I have more time!\r\nThrowing an error at least as I have never worked with axhspan and polys.\r\nOk, openning another issue.\nCan I try working on this? @ianhi @vpicouet \r\nFrom the discussion, I could identify that a quick fix would be to use a try-except block to throw an error \r\nif valinit[0] == valinit[1]\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\nSure!

(interactivity doesn't stop but it plots a lot of issues)  any updates?\n@raphaelquast no, this still needs someone to work on it.\r\n\r\nLabeled as a good first issue as there in no API design here (just returning an empty string is better than the current state).\nI can give a PR, that is based on my [last comment](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/21915#issuecomment-992454625) a try. But my concerns/questions from then are still valid.\nAs this is all internal code, I think we should just do an `isinstance(norm, BoundaryNorm)` check and then act accordingly.  There is already a bunch of instances of this in the colorbar code as precedence. \nAfter thinking about my suggestion again, I now understand why you prefer an `isinstace` check.\r\n(In my initial suggestion one would have to check if `ends` maps to (0,1) and if `normed` is in [0, 1] for the correct way to implement my idea. But these conditions are taylored to catch `BoundaryNorm` anyway, so why not do it directly.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I suggest using a try block after https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/c33557d120eefe3148ebfcf2e758ff2357966000/lib/matplotlib/artist.py#L1305\r\n```python\r\n# Midpoints of neighboring color intervals.\r\ntry:\r\n    neighbors = self.norm.inverse(\r\n        (int(normed * n) + np.array([0, 1])) / n)\r\nexcept ValueError:\r\n    # non-invertible ScalarMappable\r\n```\r\nbecause `BoundaryNorm` raises a `ValueError` anyway and I assume this to be the case for all non-invertible `ScalarMappables`.\r\n(And the issue is the exception raised from `inverse`).\r\n\r\nThe question is:\r\nWhat to put in the `except`? So what is \"acting accordingly\" in this case?\r\nIf `BoundaryNorm` isn't invertible, how can we reliably get the data values of the midpoints of neighboring colors?\r\n\r\nI think it should be enough to get the boundaries themselves, instead of the midpoints (though both is possible) with something like:\r\n```python\r\ncur_idx = np.argmin(np.abs(self.norm.boundaries - data))\r\ncur_bound = self.norm.boundaries[cur_idx]\r\nneigh_idx = cur_idx + 1 if data > cur_bound else cur_idx - 1\r\nneighbors = self.norm.boundaries[\r\n    np.array([cur_idx, neigh_idx])\r\n]\r\n```\r\nProblems with this code are:\r\n- `boundaries` property is specific to `BoundaryNorm`, isn't it? So we gained nothing by using `try .. except`\r\n- more checks are needed to cover all cases for `clip` and `extend` options of `BoundaryNorm` such that `neigh_idx` is always in bounds\r\n- for very coarse boundaries compared to data (ie: `boundaries = [0,1,2,3,4,5]; data = random(n)*5) the displayed values are always rounded to one significant digit. While in principle, this is expected (I believe), it results in inconsistency. In my example 0.111111 would be given as 0.1 and 0.001 as 0.001 and 1.234 would be just 1.\n> boundaries property is specific to BoundaryNorm, isn't it? So we gained nothing by using try .. except\r\n\r\nThis is one argument in favor of doing the `isinstance` check because then you can assert we _have_ a BoundaryNorm and can trust that you can access its state etc.   One on hand, duck typeing is in general a Good Thing in Python and we should err on the side of being forgiving on input, but sometimes the complexity of it is more trouble than it is worth if you really only have 1 case that you are trying catch!  \r\n\r\n>  I assume this to be the case for all non-invertible ScalarMappables.\r\n\r\nHowever we only (at this point) are talking about a way to recover in the case of BoundaryNorm.  Let everything else continue to fail and we will deal with those issues if/when they get reported.\nI think the correct fix is to specifically check for BoundaryNorm there and implement special logic to determine the positions of the neighboring intervals (on the BoundaryNorm) for that case.\nI tried returning the passed in `value` instead of the exception at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/b2bb7be4ba343fcec6b1dbbffd7106e6af240221/lib/matplotlib/colors.py#L1829\r\n\r\n```python\r\nreturn value\r\n```\r\nand it seems to work.

(interactivity doesn't stop but it plots a lot of issues)  any updates?\n@raphaelquast no, this still needs someone to work on it.\r\n\r\nLabeled as a good first issue as there in no API design here (just returning an empty string is better than the current state).\nI can give a PR, that is based on my [last comment](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/21915#issuecomment-992454625) a try. But my concerns/questions from then are still valid.\nAs this is all internal code, I think we should just do an `isinstance(norm, BoundaryNorm)` check and then act accordingly.  There is already a bunch of instances of this in the colorbar code as precedence. \nAfter thinking about my suggestion again, I now understand why you prefer an `isinstace` check.\r\n(In my initial suggestion one would have to check if `ends` maps to (0,1) and if `normed` is in [0, 1] for the correct way to implement my idea. But these conditions are taylored to catch `BoundaryNorm` anyway, so why not do it directly.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I suggest using a try block after https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/c33557d120eefe3148ebfcf2e758ff2357966000/lib/matplotlib/artist.py#L1305\r\n```python\r\n# Midpoints of neighboring color intervals.\r\ntry:\r\n    neighbors = self.norm.inverse(\r\n        (int(normed * n) + np.array([0, 1])) / n)\r\nexcept ValueError:\r\n    # non-invertible ScalarMappable\r\n```\r\nbecause `BoundaryNorm` raises a `ValueError` anyway and I assume this to be the case for all non-invertible `ScalarMappables`.\r\n(And the issue is the exception raised from `inverse`).\r\n\r\nThe question is:\r\nWhat to put in the `except`? So what is \"acting accordingly\" in this case?\r\nIf `BoundaryNorm` isn't invertible, how can we reliably get the data values of the midpoints of neighboring colors?\r\n\r\nI think it should be enough to get the boundaries themselves, instead of the midpoints (though both is possible) with something like:\r\n```python\r\ncur_idx = np.argmin(np.abs(self.norm.boundaries - data))\r\ncur_bound = self.norm.boundaries[cur_idx]\r\nneigh_idx = cur_idx + 1 if data > cur_bound else cur_idx - 1\r\nneighbors = self.norm.boundaries[\r\n    np.array([cur_idx, neigh_idx])\r\n]\r\n```\r\nProblems with this code are:\r\n- `boundaries` property is specific to `BoundaryNorm`, isn't it? So we gained nothing by using `try .. except`\r\n- more checks are needed to cover all cases for `clip` and `extend` options of `BoundaryNorm` such that `neigh_idx` is always in bounds\r\n- for very coarse boundaries compared to data (ie: `boundaries = [0,1,2,3,4,5]; data = random(n)*5) the displayed values are always rounded to one significant digit. While in principle, this is expected (I believe), it results in inconsistency. In my example 0.111111 would be given as 0.1 and 0.001 as 0.001 and 1.234 would be just 1.\n> boundaries property is specific to BoundaryNorm, isn't it? So we gained nothing by using try .. except\r\n\r\nThis is one argument in favor of doing the `isinstance` check because then you can assert we _have_ a BoundaryNorm and can trust that you can access its state etc.   One on hand, duck typeing is in general a Good Thing in Python and we should err on the side of being forgiving on input, but sometimes the complexity of it is more trouble than it is worth if you really only have 1 case that you are trying catch!  \r\n\r\n>  I assume this to be the case for all non-invertible ScalarMappables.\r\n\r\nHowever we only (at this point) are talking about a way to recover in the case of BoundaryNorm.  Let everything else continue to fail and we will deal with those issues if/when they get reported.",

Are there any other ways to convert 2D PolyCollections into 3D PolyCollections?\n\n```\nax.add_collection3d(hb_made, zs=shotNumber.get_array(), zdir='y')\n```\n\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 2201, in add_collection3d\n    art3d.poly_collection_2d_to_3d(col, zs=zs, zdir=zdir)\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 716, in poly_collection_2d_to_3d\n    col.set_3d_properties()\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 595, in set_3d_properties\n    self._edgecolors3d = PolyCollection.get_edgecolors(self)\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/collections.py\", line 626, in get_edgecolor\n    return self.get_facecolors()\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 699, in get_facecolors\n    return self._facecolors2d\nAttributeError: 'Poly3DCollection' object has no attribute '_facecolors2d'\n\nI don't know if this is the appropriate place to post this, but here is a temporary fix for anyone who is waiting on the permanent fix.\r\n\r\nI encounter this same error when trying to add a legend to my 3D surface plot.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsurf = axarr[0].plot_surface(XSrc, YAmb, XCorrMeanDepthErrs[CodingScheme], label=CodingScheme, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talpha=.5, facecolor=color, edgecolor='black', linewidth=2)\r\naxarr[0].legend()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile a permanent fix is find, I found that a simple temporary fix is to explicitly set the `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` parameters after creating the surface plot.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsurf = axarr[0].plot_surface(XSrc, YAmb, XCorrMeanDepthErrs[CodingScheme], label=CodingScheme, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\talpha=.5, facecolor=color, edgecolor='black', linewidth=2)\r\nsurf._facecolors2d=surf._facecolors3d\r\nsurf._edgecolors2d=surf._edgecolors3d\r\naxarr[0].legend()\r\n```\r\n\nI also could not get the legend to show in my 3d plot of planes with the error:\"AttributeError: 'Poly3DCollection' object has no attribute '_edgecolors2d'\". \r\n\r\nAlthough the fix from @felipegb94 worked: \r\nsurf._facecolors2d=surf._facecolors3d\r\nsurf._edgecolors2d=surf._edgecolors3d\r\n\r\n\nI'm remilestoning this to keep it on the radar. \nI run into this today, but now even the workaround (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/4067#issuecomment-357794003) is not working any more.\nI ran into this today, with version 3.3.1.post1012+g5584ba764, the workaround did the trick.\nI ran in to this as well, and the fix works in version 3.3.1 but not in 3.3.3\n@bootje2000 Apparently some attributes have been renamed or moved around (prima facie). Try this slight modification to @felipegb94's workaround:\r\n```\r\nsurf._facecolors2d = surf._facecolor3d\r\nsurf._edgecolors2d = surf._edgecolor3d\r\n```\r\nNote the lack of \"s\" on the RHS. `_facecolors3d` and `_edgecolors3d` do not seem to exist anymore.\r\n\r\nThis works in `matplotlib 3.3.3` as of January 04, 2021.\nNone of the workarounds work in matplotlib 3.5.1\r\nIt works after modifying for the available attributes `_facecolors `and `_edgecolors`:\r\n`surf._facecolors2d = surf._facecolors`\r\n`surf._edgecolors2d = surf._edgecolors`\r\n\r\nHint: if there are multiple surfaces on the same axes, the workaround must be applied to each surface individually.\n@nina-wwc I just checked the minimal working example in this thread using `matplotlib-3.5.1` and `3.5.2` (latest) and my workaround works as it did before, as does yours. Could you test the example code in a virtual environment perhaps, if you haven't already done so?\nThe problem still is that we update some state during the draw process.  Internally we do the updating and the access in just the right order so that in most cases we do not notice that we also add the attributes on the fly. \r\n\r\nThe best workaround for the current case (assuming 3.5):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.tri as mtri\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\r\n\r\ny,x = np.ogrid[1:10:100j, 1:10:100j]\r\nz2 = np.cos(x)**3 - np.sin(y)**2\r\nfig = plt.figure()\r\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\r\nr = ax.plot_surface(x,y,z2, cmap='hot')\r\nfig.draw_without_rendering()   # <--- This is the key line\r\nr.get_facecolors()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I still think the best solution is https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/4067#issuecomment-73389124 which will require looking in `get_facecolors` to detect when these attributes are missing (and if stale?) and then force what ever needs to be done to update them.\r\n\r\nLabeling this as a good first issue because it clearly has affected a lot of people for a long time, there is a very clear reproduction example (that will make a perfect test), and there are no API design choices to be made, but medium difficulty because it will require understanding some slightly tricking inheritance and how our 3D artists draw them selves.

When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console. I don't know why it happens, so I come here for help.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nx_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nx_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\n\r\nfig = plt.figure()\r\n        ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\r\n        ax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\r\n        ax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\r\n        clr_list = 'r-'\r\n\r\n        for n in range(np.size(z_s_0, axis=0)):\r\n            ax.plot([int(x_s_0[n]), int(x_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(y_s_0[n]), int(y_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(z_s_0[n]), int(z_e_0[n])], clr_list)\r\n\r\n        plt.xlabel('x')\r\n        plt.ylabel('y')\r\n        # ax.zlabel('z')\r\n        plt.title('90-0')\r\n        plt.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 3444, in run_code\r\n    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\r\n  File \"<ipython-input-80-e04907066a16>\", line 20, in <module>\r\n    plt.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 368, in show\r\n    return _backend_mod.show(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 29, in __call__\r\n    manager.show(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 112, in show\r\n    self.canvas.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 68, in show\r\n    FigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\", line 436, in draw\r\n    self.figure.draw(self.renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 73, in draw_wrapper\r\n    result = draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py\", line 2803, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 469, in draw\r\n    super().draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", line 3082, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 215, in draw\r\n    xs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d\r\nAttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nSome 3D lines\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\nLocal: windows + pycharm, Remote: Ubuntu 20.04\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.5.0\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nmodule://backend_interagg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.8.12\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n",

I don't think there's a public API for advancing the property cycle?

Actually in most cases I just pass empty data, but `ax.bar([], [])` doesn't return an artist (just an empty `BarContainer` so it doesn't work with that pattern.

In my case, the warnings are issued during `pytest` run which seems to activate these warnings by default.\r\n\r\nAs for the NumPy version, I'm running\r\n```console\r\n$ python -c 'import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)'\r\n1.24.0\r\n```\nThanks, I can now reproduce 😄 \nThe problem is that there are three more values, that are by default out of range in this case, to note specific cases:\r\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/8d2329ad89120410d7ef04faddba2c51db743b06/lib/matplotlib/colors.py#L673-L675\r\n(N = 256 by default)\r\n\r\nThese are then assigned to out-of-range and masked/bad values here:\r\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/8d2329ad89120410d7ef04faddba2c51db743b06/lib/matplotlib/colors.py#L730-L732\r\nwhich now raises a deprecation warning.\r\n\r\nI think that one way forward would be to check the type of `xa` for int/uint and in that case take modulo the maximum value for `self._i_over` etc. This is basically what happens now anyway, but we need to do it explicitly rather than relying on numpy doing it. (I cannot really see how this makes sense from a color perspective, but we will at least keep the current behavior.)\nI think this is exposing a real bug that we need to promote the input data to be bigger than uint8.  What we are doing here is buildin a lookup up table, the first N entries are for for values into the actually color map and then the next 3 entries are the special cases for over/under/bad so `xa` needs to be big enough to hold `self.N + 2` as values.\nI don't know if this is a bigger bug or not, but I would like us to have fixed any deprecation warnings from dependencies before 3.7 is out (or if necessary a quick 3.7.1.)",

            "hints_text": "A can confirm this behavior, but removing and recreating the objects that host the callbacks in the callbacks is definitely on the edge of the intended usage.  \r\n\r\nWhy are you doing this?  In your application can you get away with not destroying your slider?\nI think there could be a way to not destroy the slider. But I don't have the time to test that currently.\r\nMy workaround for the problem was using a button to redraw everything. With that everything is working fine.\r\n\r\nThat was the weird part for me as they are both callbacks, but in one everything works fine and in the other one all inputs are blocked. If what I'm trying doing is not the intended usage, that's fine for me. \r\nThanks for the answer.\nThe idiomatic way to destructively work on widgets that triggered an event in a UI toolkit is to do the destructive work in an idle callback:\r\n```python\r\ndef redraw():\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n    return False\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.gcf().canvas.new_timer(redraw)\r\n```\nThanks for the answer. I tried that with the code in the original post.\r\nThe line:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npyplot.gcf().canvas.new_timer(redraw)\r\n```\r\ndoesn't work for me. After having a look at the documentation, I think the line should be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npyplot.gcf().canvas.new_timer(callbacks=[(redraw, tuple(), dict())])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that still didn't work. The redraw callback doesn't seem to trigger.\nSorry, I mean to update that after testing and before posting, but forgot to. That line should be:\r\n```\r\n    pyplot.gcf().canvas.new_timer(callbacks=[redraw])\r\n```\nSorry for double posting; now I see that it didn't actually get called!\r\n\r\nThat's because I forgot to call `start` as well, and the timer was garbage collected at the end of the function. It should be called as you've said, but stored globally and started:\r\n```\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\n\r\ndef redraw():\r\n    print(\"redraw\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n    return False\r\n\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    global timer\r\n    timer = pyplot.gcf().canvas.new_timer(callbacks=[(redraw, (), {})])\r\n    timer.start()\r\n\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    global timer\r\n    timer = pyplot.gcf().canvas.new_timer(callbacks=[(redraw, (), {})])\r\n    timer.start()\r\n\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\r\n```\nThanks for the answer, the code works without errors, but I'm still able to break it when using the range slider. Then it results in the same problem as my original post. It seems like that happens when triggering the onchanged callback at the same time the timer callback gets called.\nAre you sure it's not working, or is it just that it got replaced by a new one that is using the same initial value again? For me, it moves, but once the callback runs, it's reset because the slider is created with `valinit=(1, 10)`.\nThe code redraws everything fine, but when the onchanged callback of the range slider gets called at the same time as the redraw callback of the timer, I'm not able to give any new inputs to the widgets. You can maybe reproduce that with changing the value of the slider the whole time, while waiting for the redraw.\nI think what is happening is that because you are destroying the slider every time the you are also destroying the state of what value you changed it to.  When you create it you re-create it at the default value which produces the effect that you can not seem to change it.  Put another way, the state of what the current value of the slider is is in the `Slider` object.   Replacing the slider object with a new one (correctly) forgets the old value.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI agree it fails in surprising ways, but I think that this is best case \"undefined behavior\" and worst case incorrect usage of the tools.  In either case there is not much we can do upstream to address this (as if the user _did_ want to get fresh sliders that is not a case we should prevent from happening or warn on).\nThe \"forgetting the value\" is not the problem. My problem is, that the input just blocks for every widget in the figure. When that happens, you can click on any widget, but no callback gets triggered. That problem seems to happen when a callback of an object gets called that is/has been destroyed, but I don't know for sure.\r\n\r\nBut if that is from the incorrect usage of the tools, that's fine for me. I got a decent workaround that works currently, so I just have to keep that in my code for now.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",

            "hints_text": "I'm also seeing this behavior on matplotlib 3.4.1.  Working from the [resampling data example](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/event_handling/resample.html), I've been developing an adaptive waveform plotter in [this PR](https://github.com/librosa/librosa/issues/1207) (code included there).  The specific quirks that I'm seeing are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Create two axes with shared x axis (eg, `fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, sharex=True)`), and set an axis callback on `ax0` for `xlim_changed`.  If the xlim changes on `ax1`, which does not directly have the callback set, the axes still update appropriately but the callback is never triggered.\r\n- Possibly related: if the callback is set on `ax0` first, and some time later we draw on `ax1`, the callback never triggers even if we directly set the xlims on `ax0`.\r\n\r\nNote: if I create the shared axes, draw on `ax1` first and set the callback on `ax0` last, everything works as expected.  So I don't think there's any fundamental incompatibility here.  It does seem like some data structure is being either ignored or clobbered though.\nA short self-contained example would be very helpful here!  Thanks  \n\"short\" is relative here :)  There is a full setup in the linked PR, but here's something hopefully a little more streamlined:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\n# From https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/event_handling/resample.html\r\n# A class that will downsample the data and recompute when zoomed.\r\nclass DataDisplayDownsampler:\r\n    def __init__(self, xdata, ydata):\r\n        self.origYData = ydata\r\n        self.origXData = xdata\r\n        self.max_points = 50\r\n        self.delta = xdata[-1] - xdata[0]\r\n\r\n    def downsample(self, xstart, xend):\r\n        # get the points in the view range\r\n        mask = (self.origXData > xstart) & (self.origXData < xend)\r\n        # dilate the mask by one to catch the points just outside\r\n        # of the view range to not truncate the line\r\n        mask = np.convolve([1, 1, 1], mask, mode='same').astype(bool)\r\n        # sort out how many points to drop\r\n        ratio = max(np.sum(mask) // self.max_points, 1)\r\n\r\n        # mask data\r\n        xdata = self.origXData[mask]\r\n        ydata = self.origYData[mask]\r\n\r\n        # downsample data\r\n        xdata = xdata[::ratio]\r\n        ydata = ydata[::ratio]\r\n\r\n        print(\"using {} of {} visible points\".format(len(ydata), np.sum(mask)))\r\n\r\n        return xdata, ydata\r\n\r\n    def update(self, ax):\r\n        # Update the line\r\n        lims = ax.viewLim\r\n        if abs(lims.width - self.delta) > 1e-8:\r\n            self.delta = lims.width\r\n            xstart, xend = lims.intervalx\r\n            self.line.set_data(*self.downsample(xstart, xend))\r\n            ax.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\r\n\r\n\r\n# Create a signal\r\nxdata = np.linspace(16, 365, (365-16)*4)\r\nydata = np.sin(2*np.pi*xdata/153) + np.cos(2*np.pi*xdata/127)\r\n\r\n\r\n# --- This does not work: ax1 drawn after ax0 kills callbacks\r\nd = DataDisplayDownsampler(xdata, ydata)\r\nfig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, sharex=True)\r\n\r\n# Hook up the line\r\nd.line, = ax0.plot(xdata, ydata, 'o-')\r\nax0.set_autoscale_on(False)  # Otherwise, infinite loop\r\n\r\n# Connect for changing the view limits\r\nax0.callbacks.connect('xlim_changed', d.update)\r\nax0.set_xlim(16, 365)\r\n\r\nax1.plot(xdata, -ydata)\r\nplt.show()\r\n\r\n\r\n# --- This does work: ax0 drawn after ax1\r\n# --- Note: only works if axis limits are controlled via ax0, not ax1\r\n# Create a signal\r\nxdata = np.linspace(16, 365, (365-16)*4)\r\nydata = np.sin(2*np.pi*xdata/153) + np.cos(2*np.pi*xdata/127)\r\n\r\nd = DataDisplayDownsampler(xdata, ydata)\r\n\r\nfig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, sharex=True)\r\n\r\nax1.plot(xdata, -ydata)\r\n\r\n# Hook up the line\r\nd.line, = ax0.plot(xdata, ydata, 'o-')\r\nax0.set_autoscale_on(False)  # Otherwise, infinite loop\r\n\r\n# Connect for changing the view limits\r\nax0.callbacks.connect('xlim_changed', d.update)\r\nax0.set_xlim(16, 365)\r\n\r\n\r\nplt.show()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn neither case does panning/zooming/setting limits on `ax1` do the right thing.\nThats not bad ;-)\nThe problem is that we do \r\n```\r\nother.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx, emit=False, auto=auto)\r\n```\r\nwhich doesn't do the `ax0.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)` \r\n\r\nIf we don't do this, it continues to emit to the shared axes and we get an infinite recursion.  \r\n\r\nSomething like \r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py b/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\r\nindex 9898c7c75..0c1941efb 100644\r\n--- a/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\r\n+++ b/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\r\n@@ -3742,10 +3742,11 @@ class _AxesBase(martist.Artist):\r\n             # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one\r\n             for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):\r\n                 if other is not self:\r\n-                    other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,\r\n-                                   emit=False, auto=auto)\r\n-                    if other.figure != self.figure:\r\n-                        other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\r\n+                    if not np.allclose(other.viewLim.intervalx, self.viewLim.intervalx):\r\n+                        other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,\r\n+                                    emit=True, auto=auto)\r\n+                        if other.figure != self.figure:\r\n+                            other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes the problem (plus we'd need the same for yaxis).

As far as I can tell from reading https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py , it should support multiple callbacks on the same signal (or am I misunderstanding?), but the above example when run twice only issues the second callback.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is unrelated, I can open a separate issue for it.\nI'm not exactly sure what you mean, but note that CallbackRegistry currently drops duplicate callbacks (connecting a same callback a second time to the same signal results in it being dropped and the original cid is returned).  I actually think that's a pretty unhelpful behavior and would be happy to see it deprecated (that can just go through a normal deprecation cycle), but that would be a separate issue.\nAh, I see.  Thanks @anntzer for the clarification.\nI am :+1: on @anntzer 's solution here.\r\n\r\nMarking this as a good first issue because we have a patch for it.  Will still need to write a test, a simplified version of the initial bug report would probably work (we do not need convolve in the tests / real signals etc).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nalso good to see fellow NYers around!\nHaving the same problem with perhaps a somewhat simpler example. If the registered callbacks were triggered by changes in axes limits from plots with shared x/y-axes, the gray dashed line in the left plot would extend across the whole canvas:\r\n\r\n![tmp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30958850/130777946-5fd58887-d4e3-4287-a6e7-1be4a093fa98.png)\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Any\r\n\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfrom matplotlib.axes import Axes\r\n\r\n\r\ndef add_identity(ax: Axes = None, **line_kwargs: Any) -> None:\r\n    \"\"\"Add a parity line (y = x) to the provided axis.\"\"\"\r\n    if ax is None:\r\n        ax = plt.gca()\r\n\r\n    # zorder=0 ensures other plotted data displays on top of line\r\n    default_kwargs = dict(alpha=0.5, zorder=0, linestyle=\"dashed\", color=\"black\")\r\n    (identity,) = ax.plot([], [], **default_kwargs, **line_kwargs)\r\n\r\n    def callback(axes: Axes) -> None:\r\n        x_min, x_max = axes.get_xlim()\r\n        y_min, y_max = axes.get_ylim()\r\n        low = max(x_min, y_min)\r\n        high = min(x_max, y_max)\r\n        identity.set_data([low, high], [low, high])\r\n\r\n    callback(ax)\r\n    # Register callbacks to update identity line when moving plots in interactive\r\n    # mode to ensure line always extend to plot edges.\r\n    ax.callbacks.connect(\"xlim_changed\", callback)\r\n    ax.callbacks.connect(\"ylim_changed\", callback)\r\n\r\n\r\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex=True, sharey=True)\r\n\r\nax1.plot([0, 1], [1, 0])\r\nadd_identity(ax1)\r\n\r\nax2.plot([0, 2], [2, 0])\r\nadd_identity(ax2)\r\n\r\nplt.savefig('tmp.png')\r\n```\nWhile not the point of this issue, that identity line can be achieved with [`axline`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.axline.html).\n@QuLogic Damn, that's what I get for not reading the docs closely enough: unnecessary work reinventing a (worse) wheel.

            "hints_text": "This could probably be made to work by:\r\n\r\n a) renaming the `axis` property on `.mpl_axes.Axes` to something that does not collide with an existing method\r\n b) doing on-the-fly multiple inheritance in AxesGrid if the input axes class does not already inherit from the said Axes extension\nOk. It this begs the question of why one would use axes grid for cartopy axes?\nAn alternative change here would be to put is the type check and raise an informative error that it is not going to work.\nOTOH it may be nice to slowly move axes_grid towards an API more consistent with the rest of mpl.  From a very, very quick look, I guess its `axis` dict could be compared to normal axes' `spines` dict?  (an AxisArtist is vaguely like a Spine, I guess).\n> Ok. It this begs the question of why one would use axes grid for cartopy axes?\r\n\r\nThere's an [example in the Cartopy docs](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/axes_grid_basic.html).\nFor that example I get `TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable`\nSo, I'm confused, is `axes_grid` the only way to make an array of axes from an arbitrary axes subclass?  I don't see the equivalent of `axes_class=GeoAxes` for `fig.add_subplot` or `fig.subplots` etc. \nSorry for the above, I see now.  That example could be changed to \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    fig, axgr = plt.subplots(3, 2, constrained_layout=True,\r\n                             subplot_kw={'projection':projection})\r\n    axgr = axgr.flat\r\n...\r\n   fig.colorbar(p, ax=axgr, shrink=0.6, extend='both')\r\n```\n@jklymak the reason why I went to use AxesGrid was because it seemed the easiest for me to create multiple GeoAxes instances flexibly (i.e. with or without colorbar axes, and with flexible location of those) and with an easy control of both horizonal and vertical padding of GeoAxis instances and independently, of the colorbar axes, also because the aspect of maps (lat / lon range) tends to mess with the alignment. \r\nI know that this can all be solved via subplots or GridSpec, etc., but I found that AxisGrid was the most simple way to do this (after trying other options and always ending up having overlapping axes ticklabels or too large padding between axes, etc.). AxesGrid seems to be made for my problem and it was very easy for me to set up a subplot grid meeting my needs for e.g. plotting 12 monthly maps of climate model data with proper padding, etc. \r\n![multimap_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12813228/78986627-f310dc00-7b2b-11ea-8d47-a5c90b68171d.png)\r\n\r\nThe code I used to create initiate this figure is based on the example from the cartopy website that @QuLogic mentions above:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(18, 7))\r\naxes_class = (GeoAxes, dict(map_projection=ccrs.PlateCarree()))\r\naxgr = AxesGrid(fig, 111, axes_class=axes_class,\r\n                    nrows_ncols=(3, 4),\r\n                    axes_pad=(0.6, 0.5), # control padding separately for e.g. colorbar labels, axes titles, etc.\r\n                    cbar_location='right',\r\n                    cbar_mode=\"each\",\r\n                    cbar_pad=\"5%\",\r\n                    cbar_size='3%',\r\n                    label_mode='') \r\n\r\n# here follows the plotting code of the displayed climate data using pyaerocom by loading a 2010 monthly example model dataset, looping over the (GeoAxes, cax) instances of the grid and calling pyaerocom.plot.mapping.plot_griddeddata_on_map on the monthly subsets.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, @jklymak I was not aware of the `constrained_layout` option in `subplots` and indeed, looking at [the constrained layout guide](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide.html), this seems to provide the control needed to not mess with padding / spacing etc. I will try this out for my problem. Nonetheless, since cartopy refers to the AxesGrid option, it may be good if this issue could be fixed in any case.\r\n\r\nAlso, constrained layout itself is declared experimental in the above guide and may be deprecated, so it may be a bit uncertain for users and developers that build upon matplotlib, what option to go for.\r\n\r\n\n@jgliss Yeah, I think I agree that `axes_grid` is useful to pack subplots together that have a certain aspect ratio.  Core matplotlib takes the opposite approach and puts the white space between the axes, `axes_grid` puts the space around the axes.  \r\n\r\nI agree with @anntzer comment above (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/17069#issuecomment-611635018), but feel that we should move axes_grid into core matplotlib and change the API as we see fit when we do so.  \r\n\r\nI also agree that its time `constrained_layout` drops its experimental tag. \r\n\r\nBack on topic, though, this seems to be a regression and we should fix it.  \nRe-milestoned to 3.2.2 as this seems like it is a regression, not \"always broken\"?\nRight after I re-milestoned I see that this is with 3.1.2 so I'm confused if this ever worked?\nI re-milestoned this to 3.4 as I don't think this has ever worked without setting the kwarg `label_mode=''` (it is broken at least as far back as 2.1.0).\nActually, looks simple enough to just check what kind of object ax.axis is:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git i/lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py w/lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py\r\nindex 2b1b1d3200..8b947a5836 100644\r\n--- i/lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py\r\n+++ w/lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py\r\n@@ -1,5 +1,6 @@\r\n from numbers import Number\r\n import functools\r\n+from types import MethodType\r\n\r\n import numpy as np\r\n\r\n@@ -7,14 +8,20 @@ from matplotlib import _api, cbook\r\n from matplotlib.gridspec import SubplotSpec\r\n\r\n from .axes_divider import Size, SubplotDivider, Divider\r\n-from .mpl_axes import Axes\r\n+from .mpl_axes import Axes, SimpleAxisArtist\r\n\r\n\r\n def _tick_only(ax, bottom_on, left_on):\r\n     bottom_off = not bottom_on\r\n     left_off = not left_on\r\n-    ax.axis[\"bottom\"].toggle(ticklabels=bottom_off, label=bottom_off)\r\n-    ax.axis[\"left\"].toggle(ticklabels=left_off, label=left_off)\r\n+    if isinstance(ax.axis, MethodType):\r\n+        bottom = SimpleAxisArtist(ax.xaxis, 1, ax.spines[\"bottom\"])\r\n+        left = SimpleAxisArtist(ax.yaxis, 1, ax.spines[\"left\"])\r\n+    else:\r\n+        bottom = ax.axis[\"bottom\"]\r\n+        left = ax.axis[\"left\"]\r\n+    bottom.toggle(ticklabels=bottom_off, label=bottom_off)\r\n+    left.toggle(ticklabels=left_off, label=left_off)\r\n\r\n\r\n class CbarAxesBase:\r\n```\r\nseems to be enough.",

The problem is that `PairGrid` now lets `hue` at the grid-level delegate to the axes-level functions if they have `hue` in their signature. But it's not properly handling the case where `hue` is *not* set for the grid, but *is* specified for one mapped function. @jhncls's workaround suggests the fix.\r\n\r\nAn easier workaround would have been to set `PairGrid(..., hue=\"species\")` and then pass `.map(..., hue=None)` where you don't want to separate by species. But `regplot` is the one axis-level function that does not yet handle hue-mapping internally, so it doesn't work for this specific case. It would have if you wanted a single bivariate density over hue-mapped scatterplot points (i.e. [this example](http://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html#classes-and-functions-for-making-complex-graphics) or something similar.",

I have ideas as to where the DecodeError might be coming from but I'm not certain where the TimeoutError could be coming from.\n\nIf you run into them again, please save us the stack traces. =) Thanks for reporting them. (We'll never know what we're missing until someone tells us.)\n\n`TimeoutError` is almost certainly being raised from either [`HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen()`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L282-L293) or from [`HTTPConnection.putrequest()`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L301). Adding a new clause to [here](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L323-L335) should cover us.\n\nActually, that can't be right, we should be catching and rethrowing as a Requests `Timeout` exception in that block. Hmm, I'll do another spin through the code to see if I can see the problem.\n\nYeah, a quick search of the `urllib3` code reveals that the only place that `TimeoutError`s are thrown is from `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen()`. These should not be leaking. We really need a stack trace to track this down.\n\nI've added a few logs to get the traces if they happen again. What may have confused me for the TimeoutError is that requests' Timeout actually wraps the urllib3's TimeoutError and we were logging the content of the error as well. \n\nSo DecodeError was definitely being thrown but probably not TimeoutError, sorry for the confusion. I'll report here it I ever see it happening now that we're watching for it.\n\nThanks for the help!\n\nI also got urllib3 exceptions passing through when use Session in several threads, trace:\n\n```\n......\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 347, in get\n    return self.request('GET', url, **kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 335, in request\n    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 438, in send\n    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\adapters.py\", line 292, in send\n    timeout=timeout\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\packages\\urllib3\\connectionpool.py\", line 423, in url\nopen\n    conn = self._get_conn(timeout=pool_timeout)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\packages\\urllib3\\connectionpool.py\", line 224, in _ge\nt_conn\n    raise ClosedPoolError(self, \"Pool is closed.\")\nClosedPoolError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='......', port=80): Pool is closed.\n```\n\nAh, we should rewrap that `ClosedPoolError` too.\n\nBut it's still the summer...

How about\r\n```\r\n<xarray.Dataset>\r\nDimensions:  (time: 3, x: 988, y: 822)\r\nCoordinates:\r\n  * x             (x)          [m]     float64 ...\r\n  * y             (y)          [m]     float64 ...\r\n  * time          (time)       [s]     datetime64[ns] ...\r\nData variables:\r\n    rainfall      (time, y, x) [mm]    float32 ...\r\n    max_temp      (time, y, x) [deg C] float32 ...\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n<xarray.Dataset>\r\nDimensions:  (time: 3, x: 988, y: 822)\r\nCoordinates:\r\n  * x             (x)             float64 [m] ...\r\n  * y             (y)             float64 [m] ...\r\n  * time          (time)          datetime64[ns] [s] ...\r\nData variables:\r\n    rainfall      (time, y, x)    float32 [mm] ...\r\n    max_temp      (time, y, x)    float32 [deg C] ...\r\n```\r\nThe issue with the second example is that it is easy to confuse with numpy's dtype, though. Maybe we should use parentheses instead?\r\n\r\nre special casing: I think would be fine for attributes since we already special case them for plotting, but I don't know about duck arrays. Even if we want to special case them, there are many unit libraries with different interfaces so we would either need to special case all of them or require a specific interface (or a function to retrieve the necessary data?).\r\n\r\nAlso, we should keep in mind is that using more horizontal space for the units results in less space for data. And we should not forget about https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/5329#issue-485927396, where a different kind of format was proposed, at least for the values of a `DataArray`.\nInstead of trying to come up with our own formatting, how about supporting a `_repr_short_(self, length)` method on the duck array (with a fall back to the current behavior)? That way duck arrays have to explicitly define the format (or have a compatibility package like `pint-xarray` provide it for them) if they want something different from their normal repr and we don't have to add duck array specific code.\r\n\r\nThis won't help with displaying the `units` attributes (which we don't really need once we have support for pint arrays in indexes).",

BUT I'm probably wrong.\r\n\r\n> {\"foo\": ((\"x\", \"y\"), ds.foo[1:, :]), \"bar\": (\"x\", ds.bar[1:])}\r\n\r\nThis syntax is weird. You should be able to do `update_dict = {\"foo\": ds.foo[1:, :], \"bar\": ds.bar[1:]}` . \r\n\r\nFor the simple example,  `ds.update(update_dict)` and `ds.assign(update_dict)` both fail because you can't align dimensions without labels when the dimension size is different between variables (I find this confusing). \r\n\r\n@chunhochow What are you trying to do? Overwrite the existing `foo` and `bar` variables?\n> when the dimension size is different between variables (I find this confusing).\r\n\r\nI guess the issue is that the dataset has `x` at a certain size and by reassigning we're trying to set `x` to a different size. I *think* the failure is expected in this case, and it could be solved by assigning labels to `x`.\r\n\r\nThinking about the initial problem some more, it might be better to simply point to `isel`:\r\n```python\r\nds2 = ds.isel(x=slice(1, None))\r\nds2\r\n```\r\nshould do the same, but without having to worry about manually reconstructing a valid dataset. \nYes, I'm trying to drop the last \"bin\" of data (the edge has problems) along all the DataArrays along the dimension `x`, But I couldn't figure out the syntax for how to do it from reading the documentation. Thank you! I will try `isel` next week when I get back to it!\n",

        "initialContext": "Trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy text representation\nWhen displaying a DatasetGroupBy in an interactive Python session, the first line of output contains a trailing whitespace. The first example in the documentation demonstrate this:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> import xarray as xr, numpy as np\r\n>>> ds = xr.Dataset(\r\n...     {\"foo\": ((\"x\", \"y\"), np.random.rand(4, 3))},\r\n...     coords={\"x\": [10, 20, 30, 40], \"letters\": (\"x\", list(\"abba\"))},\r\n... )\r\n>>> ds.groupby(\"letters\")\r\nDatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \r\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output which is \"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \". This can be seen more clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before `\\n`):\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> str(ds.groupby(\"letters\"))\r\n\"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't a problem in itself, it causes an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code is correctly formatted and we also have doctests that rely on DatasetGroupBy textual representation. Flake8 reports a violation on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctests fail because the expected output doesn't match the actual output. So we have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable. Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctest want the expected output to be exactly the same as the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference. We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violation for the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunately it's not possible to just add `# NoQA` comments to get flake8 to ignore the violation only for specific lines because that creates a difference between expected and actual output from doctest point of view. Flake8 doesn't allow to disable checks for blocks of code either.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason for having this trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy representation? Whould it be OK to remove it? If so please let me know and I can make a pull request.\n",

The root cause is following. The decision of skipping the path is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/3c5eca2ded3dd2b59ebaf23eb289453b5d2930f0/pylint/lint/pylinter.py#L600-L607\r\n\r\n* When you execute pylint with `src/` argument following variables are present:\r\n```python\r\n(Pdb) p root\r\n'src/gen'\r\n(Pdb) p self.config.ignore_paths\r\n[re.compile('^src\\\\\\\\gen\\\\\\\\.*$|^src/gen/.*$')]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* When you uexecute pylint with `.` argument following variables are present:\r\n```python\r\n(Pdb) p root\r\n'./src/gen'\r\n(Pdb) p self.config.ignore_paths\r\n[re.compile('^src\\\\\\\\gen\\\\\\\\.*$|^src/gen/.*$')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the second case, the source is prefixed with `./` which causes that path is not matched. The simple fix should be to use  `os.path.normpath()` https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.normpath",

Similar to the helpful output when passing an unrecognized option to Pylint, we could give a friendly output indicating that the regex pattern is invalid without the traceback; happy to put a MR together if you agree.\nThanks @mbyrnepr2 I did not even realize it was a crash that we had to fix before your comment.\n@mbyrnepr2 I think in the above stacktrace on line 1858 makes the most sense.\n\nWe need to decide though if we continue to run the program. I think it makes sense to still quit. If we catch regex errors there and pass we will also \"allow\" ignore path regexes that don't work. I don't think we should do that.\n\nImo, incorrect regexes are a little different from other \"incorrect\" options, since there is little risk that they are valid on other interpreters or versions such as old messages etc. Therefore, I'd prefer to (cleanly) exit.\nIndeed @DanielNoord I think we are on the same page regarding this point; I would also exit instead of passing if the regex is invalid. That line you mention, we can basically try/except on re.error and exit printing the details of the pattern which is invalid.",

        "initialContext": "Improve handling of skip for module level\nThis is potentially about updating docs, updating error messages or introducing a new API.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n`pos_only.py` is using Python 3,8 syntax:\r\n```python\r\ndef foo(a, /, b):\r\n    return a + b\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should not be tested under Python 3.6 and 3.7.\r\nThis is a proper way to skip the test in Python older than 3.8:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pytest import raises, skip\r\nimport sys\r\nif sys.version_info < (3, 8):\r\n    skip(msg=\"Requires Python >= 3.8\", allow_module_level=True)\r\n\r\n# import must be after the module level skip:\r\nfrom pos_only import *\r\n\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    assert foo(10, 20) == 30\r\n    assert foo(10, b=20) == 30\r\n    with raises(TypeError):\r\n        assert foo(a=10, b=20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy actual test involves parameterize and a 3.8 only class, so skipping the test itself is not sufficient because the 3.8 class was used in the parameterization.\r\n\r\nA naive user will try to initially skip the module like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif sys.version_info < (3, 8):\r\n    skip(msg=\"Requires Python >= 3.8\")\r\n```\r\nThis issues this error:\r\n\r\n>Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).\r\n\r\nThe correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.\r\n\r\nThis area feels a bit unpolished.\r\nA few ideas to improve:\r\n\r\n1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.\r\n2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module(\"reason\")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.\r\n\r\n\n",

If called outside of a test, an error message is issues.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n> pytest.skip should only be used inside tests. To skip a module use pytest.skip_module. To completely skip a test function or a test class, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators.\r\n\r\nGetting to this end state would include deprecating allow_module_level first, directing people using pytest.skip(allow_module_level=True) to use pytest.skip_module().\r\n\r\nI am also fine with just changing the message as you initially proposed but I feel this proposal will result in an healthier state.\r\n\n-0.5 from my side - I think this is too minor to warrant another deprecation and change.\nI agree it would be healthier, but -1 from me for the same reasons as @The-Compiler: we already had a deprecation/change period in order to introduce `allow_module_level`, having yet another one is frustrating/confusing to users, in comparison to the small gains.\nHi, I see that this is still open. If available, I'd like to take this up.",

This should be fixed but we would need to check the math to choose the correct variant, add a test and remove the other one.\nI don't think the math is wrong or inconsistent.  I think it's a matter of `fit_predict` returning the fit from the last of `n_iter` iterations, when it should be returning the fit from the _best_ of the iterations.  That is, the last call to `self._e_step()` (base.py:263) should be moved to just before the return, after `self._set_parameters(best_params)` restores the best solution.\nSeems good indeed. When looking quickly you can miss the fact that `_e_step` uses the parameters even if not passed as arguments because they are attributes of the estimator. That's what happened to me :)\r\n\r\n Would you submit a PR ?",

See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n",

I'll update this issue when it becomes something presentable.\r\n\r\nmaybe you can pitch me and if you want I can give a hand :)\nI would have loved to using the typing system to get this to work:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef __init__(\r\n    self,\r\n    C: Annotated[float, Range('[0, Inf)')],\r\n    ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that would have to wait for [PEP 593](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593/). In the end, I would want the validator to be a part of sklearn estimators. Using typing (as above) is a natural choice, since it keeps the parameter and its constraint physically close to each other.\r\n\r\nIf we can't use typing, these constraints can be place in a `_validate_parameters` method. This will be called at the beginning of fit to do parameter validation. Estimators that need more validation will overwrite the method, call `super()._validate_parameters` and do more validation. For example, `LogesticRegression`'s `penalty='l2'` only works for specify solvers. `skconfig` defines a framework for handling these situations, but I think it would be too hard to learn.\n>  Using typing (as above) is a natural choice\r\n\r\nI agree, and to go further it would be really nice to use them for the coverage to check that every possible type of a parameter is covered by tests\r\n\r\n> If we can't use typing, these constraints can be place in a _validate_parameters method. \r\n\r\nThis is already the case for a subset of the estimators (`_check_params` or `_validate_input`). But it's often incomplete.\r\n\r\n> skconfig defines a framework for handling these situations, but I think it would be too hard to learn.\r\n\r\nYour framework does way more than what I proposed. Maybe we can do this in 2 steps:\r\nFirst, a simple single param check which only checks its type and if its value is acceptable in general (e.g. positive for a number of clusters). This will raise a standard error message\r\nThen a more advanced check, depending on the data (e.g. number of clusters should be < n_samples) or consistency across params (e.g. solver + penalty). These checks require more elaborate error messages.\r\n\r\nwdyt ?",

In this way, the `predict` call will not call the wrapper that is around the public `transform` method. I think this is even cleaner than the previous code.\n/take",

This exception is held in `FeatureUnion` when processing data and tries to make sure that the output index is the same as the input index. In principle, we can have a less restrictive requirement and only set the index if it is not defined.\r\n\r\nTo better understand your use case, how do you intend to use the `FeatureUnion` in the overall pipeline?\r\n\r\n\n> Scikit-learn transformers expects that transform's output have the same number of samples as the input\r\n\r\nI haven't known that. Good to know. What is the correct way to aggregate or drop rows in a pipeline? Isn't that supported?\r\n\r\n> To better understand your use case, how do you intend to use the FeatureUnion in the overall pipeline?\r\n\r\nThe actual use case: I have a time series (`price`) with hourly frequency. It is a single series with a datetime index. I have built a dataframe with pipeline and custom transformers (by also violating the rule to have same number of inputs and outputs) which aggregates the data (calculates daily mean, and some moving average of daily means) then I have transformed back to hourly frequency (using same values for all the hours of a day). So the dataframe has (`date`, `price`, `mean`, `moving_avg`) columns at that point with hourly frequency (\"same number input/output\" rule violated again). After that I have added the problematic `FeatureUnion`. One part of the union simply drops `price` and \"collapses\" the remaining part to daily data (as I said all the remaining columns has the same values on the same day). On the other part of the feature union I calculate a standard devition between `price` and `moving_avg` on daily basis. So I have the (`date`, `mean`, `moving_avg`) on the left side of the feature union and an `std` on the right side. Both have daily frequency. I would like to have a dataframe with (`date`, `mean`, `moving_avg`, `std`) at the end of the transformation.\nAs I see there is the same \"problem\" in `ColumnTransfromer`.\nI have a look at how `scikit-learn` encapsulates output into a `DataFrame` and found this code block:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/utils/_set_output.py#L55-L62\r\n\r\nIs there any reason to set index here? If transformer returned a `DataFrame` this already has some kind of index. Why should we restore the original input index? What is the use case when a transformer changes the `DataFrame`'s index and `scikit-learn` has to restore it automatically to the input index?\r\n\r\nWith index restoration it is also expected for transformers that index should not be changed (or if it is changed by transformer then `scikit-learn` restores the original one which could be a bit unintuitive). Is this an intended behaviour?\r\n\r\nWhat is the design decision to not allow changing index and row count in data by transformers? In time series problems I think it is very common to aggregate raw data and modify original index.",

Please let me know your purpose in detail.\nFrom a [separate github thread](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/pull/3033#issuecomment-662515605) that describes the specific use case in some more detail:\r\n> When run in a builddir, `src/cmd/flux` sets `MANPATH` such that `man flux` will display the current builddir version of `flux.1`. This is done so that documentation matches the version of Flux being run.\r\n\r\nEssentially, we are trying to make running in-tree look as similar to running an installed version as possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> I think that users should copy the generated man file to the appropriate directory.\r\n\r\nOn `make install`, we do have the automake setup to copy the manpages to `$prefix/man/man1`, `$prefix/man/man3`, etc.  This did require some extra work though, since each source file and its destination has to be explicitly enumerated in the automake file.  If the man pages were built into their respective sections, a recursive copy would work too.  Not a huge deal, but just another factor I wanted to bring up.\nUnderstandable. +1 to change the structure of output directory. As commented, it causes a breaking change for users. So I propose you to add a configuration `man_make_section_directory = (True | False)` for migration. During 3.x, it defaults to False, and it will default to True on 4.0 release. What do you think?\r\n\r\n>I’m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a man/ directory.\r\n\r\nIt would be very nice if you send us a PR :-)\r\n",

Perhaps this restriction about tables needing a title could be documented more clearly?\nThe `numfig` option has been described as follows.\r\n\r\n>If true, figures, tables and code-blocks are automatically numbered if they have a caption.\r\nhttps://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-numfig\r\n\r\nIt says a table not having a title is not assigned a number. Then `numfig` can't refer it because of no table number.\n> It says a table not having a title is not assigned a number. Then `numfig` can't refer it because of no table number.\r\n\r\nThis means that a user is not able to add a numbered table with no caption correct? I could understand such restrictions for Jupyter Book but it doesn't make a lot of sense for Sphinx IMO. I think Sphinx should allow users to have enumerable nodes with no caption. What do you think @choldgraf?\n>This means that a user is not able to add a numbered table with no caption correct?\r\n\r\nYes. Since the beginning, numfig feature only supports captioned figures and tables. I don't know how many people want to assign numbers to non-captioned items. But this is the first feature request, AFAIK.\nI think my take is that I don't think it is super useful to be able to have numbered references for things that don't have titles/captions. However, it also didn't feel like it *shouldn't* be possible, and so I assumed that it was possible (and thus ran into what I thought was a bug). I think it would be more helpful to surface a more informative warning like \"You attempted to add a numbered reference to a Table without a title, add a title for this to work.\" (or, surface this gotcha in the documentation more obviously like with a `warning` or `note` directive?)\n@tk0miya @choldgraf both make good points for restricting `figure` and `table` directives with no caption. My issue is that this is done at the enumerable node which implies that **all** enumerable nodes with no title/caption are skipped - not just `figure` and `table`.\r\n\r\n> Since the beginning, numfig feature only supports captioned figures and tables.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, `numfig` feature has - prior to v3.3.0 - supported uncaptioned tables but it did not display the caption. The user was able to reference the table using `numref` role (see example below). In the event that the user tried to reference the caption (aka `name` placeholder), Sphinx threw a warning indicating that there was no caption. This solution seemed sensible to me because it allowed other extensions to utilize enumerable nodes regardless of caption/no caption restriction.\r\n\r\nMy main motivation for wanting to revert back or restrict the bugfix to tables and figures is because both the extensions I've worked on depend on the utilization of enumerable nodes regardless of captions/no captions. I think it wouldn't be too difficult to add the information to `env.toc_fignumbers` but I wanted to make a case before I addressed this in [sphinx-proof](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-proof) and [sphinx-exercise](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise).\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\nSphinx Version - v3.2.1\r\n\r\n````md\r\n```{list-table} \r\n:header-rows: 1\r\n:name: table1\r\n\r\n* - Training\r\n  - Validation\r\n* - 0\r\n  - 5\r\n* - 13720\r\n  - 2744\r\n```\r\nReferencing table using `numref`: {numref}`table1`.\r\n\r\n```{list-table} Caption here\r\n:header-rows: 1\r\n:name: table2\r\n\r\n* - Training\r\n  - Validation\r\n* - 0\r\n  - 5\r\n* - 13720\r\n  - 2744\r\n```\r\nReferencing table using `numref`: {numref}`table2`.\r\n````\r\n\r\n<img width=\"286\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-11-10 at 1 13 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33075058/98672880-c8ebfa80-2356-11eb-820f-8c192fcfe1d8.png\">\nSo it sounds like the `tl;dr` from @najuzilu is that in other extensions, she is *using* the fact that you can reference non-captioned elements with a number, and that Sphinx now removing this ability is breaking those extensions. Is that right?\nThat's correct @choldgraf \nThis is a screenshot of the PDF that is generated from @najuzilu 's example with v3.2.1.

This is what pinned versions are for, additionally, you can have your project specify a minimum and maximum sphinx as a requirement.\nI agree that there's some philosophical differences at play here. Our project wants to be able to build on a fairly wide range of supported and shipping distributions (we go for \"the versions of major distros still supported by the distro vendor\", roughly), and we follow the usual/traditional C project/Linux distro approach of \"build with the versions of libraries, dependencies and tools shipped by the build platform\" generally. At the moment that means we need our docs to build with Sphinx versions ranging from 1.6 through to 3.2, and the concept of a \"pinned version\" just doesn't exist in this ecosystem. Being able to build with the distro version of Sphinx is made much more awkward if the documentation markup language is not a well specified and stable target for documentation authors to aim at.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the current documentation of the option:: directive in https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/domains.html?highlight=option#directive-option says nothing about this requirement for -, --, / or +.\r\n\nFor the moment I've dealt with this by rewriting the fragment of documentation to avoid the option directive. I don't want to get into an argument if the Sphinx project doesn't feel that strong backward-compatibility guarantees are a project goal, so I thought I'd just write up my suggestions/hopes for sphinx-build more generally for you to consider (or reject!) and leave it at that:\r\n\r\n* Where directives/markup have a required syntax for their arguments, it would be useful if the documentation clearly and precisely described the syntax. That allows documentation authors to know whether they're using something as intended.\r\n* Where possible, the initial implementation should start with tightly parsing that syntax and diagnosing errors. It's much easier to loosen restrictions or use a previously forbidden syntax for a new purpose if older implementations just rejected it rather than if they accepted it and did something different because they didn't parse it very strictly.\r\n* Where major changes are necessary, a reasonable length period of deprecation and parallel availability of old and new syntax helps to ease transitions.\r\n\r\nand on a more general note I would appreciate it if the project considered the needs of external non-Python projects that have adopted Sphinx as a documentation system but which don't necessarily have the same control over tooling versions that Python-ecosystem projects might. (The Linux kernel is another good example here.)\r\n\n> Where major changes are necessary, a reasonable length period of deprecation and parallel availability of old and new syntax helps to ease transitions.\r\n\r\nMajor versions are done via semver, where Sphinx 2 is a major breaking change over Sphinx 1, and Sphinx 3 breaks changes over Sphinx 2. What other things could be done? The concept of deprecation isn't as common in Python communities due to the popularity of fixed versions or locking to a major version. IE ``pip install sphinx==3`` which installs the latest major sphinx version of 3.\nThis change was added at https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/7770. It is not an expected change. It means this is a mere bug.",

'e' is an identity matrix.  The total sum should be the same as the number of diagonal elements, which is 'n'.\nThe problem appears to be that while `e[0,0] == e[j,j] == 1`, `e[I,j] == 0` -- it assumes that if the indices are different then you are off-diagonal rather than not evaluating them at all because it is not known if `i == j`. I would start by looking in an `eval` method for this object. Inequality of indices *only for Numbers* should give 0 (while equality of numbers or expressions should give 1).\n@smichr I see.  Thank you for your enlightenment.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this situation be similar to `KroneckerDelta(i, j)`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ni, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\r\nn = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\r\nSum(Sum(KroneckerDelta(i, j), (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit()\r\n```\r\ngives the following answer:\r\n\r\n`Sum(Piecewise((1, And(0 <= j, j <= n - 1)), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))`\r\n\r\nIf SymPy can reduce this formula to `n`, I suppose reduction of `e[i, j]` to a KroneckerDelta is a candidate solution.\n@smichr I would like to work on this issue.\r\nWhere should I start looking\r\nand have a look \r\n```\r\n>>> Sum(e[k, 0], (i, 0, n-1))\r\nSum(0, (i, 0, n - 1))\r\n```\r\nwhy??\n@smichr You are right. It is ignoring i==j case. What do you mean by eval method? Please elaborate a little bit on how do you want it done. I am trying to solve it.\r\n@wakita I think you already know it by now but I am just clarifying anyways, e[i,i] in my code will be evaluated as sum of diagonals n times which gives `n*n` or `n**2.` So it is evaluating it correctly.\r\n@SatyaPrakashDwibedi I have already started working on this issue. If you find anything useful please do inform me. It would be a great help. More the merrier :)\r\n@SatyaPrakashDwibedi The thing is it is somehow omitting the case where (in e[firstelement, secondelement]) the first element == second element. That is why even though when we write [k,0] it is giving 0. I have tried several other combinations and this result is consistent.\r\nHow ever if we write `print(Sum(Sum(e[0, 0], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())` output is `n**2` as it is evaluating adding e[0,0] `n*n` times.\r\n\n> I wonder if this situation be similar to KroneckerDelta(i, j)\r\n\r\nExactly. Notice how the KD is evaluated as a `Piecewise` since we don't know whether `i==j` until actual values are substituted.\r\n\r\nBTW, you don't have to write two `Sum`s; you can have a nested range:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> Sum(i*j,(i,1,3),(j,1,3)).doit()  # instead of Sum(Sum(i*j, (i,1,3)), (j,1,3)).doit()\r\n36\r\n>>> sum([i*j for i in range(1,4) for j in range(1,4)])\r\n36\r\n```\nOK, it's the `_entry` method of the `Identity` that is the culprit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def _entry(self, i, j):\r\n        if i == j:\r\n            return S.One\r\n        else:\r\n            return S.Zero\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should just return `KroneckerDelta(i, j)`. When it does then\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> print(Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, (0 <= j) & (j <= n - 1)), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> t=_\r\n>>> t.subs(n,3)\r\n3\r\n>>> t.subs(n,30)\r\n30\r\n```\r\n\r\nbreadcrumb: tracing is a great way to find where such problems are located. I started a trace with the expression `e[1,2]` and followed the trace until I saw where the 0 was being returned: in the `_entry` method.\n@smichr I guess,it is fixed then.Nothing else to be done?\n```\r\n>>> Sum(KroneckerDelta(i, j), (i, 0, n-1), (j, 0, n-1)).doit()\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, j <= n - 1), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think, given that (j, 0, n-1), we can safely say that `j <= n - 1` always holds.  Under this condition, the Piecewise form can be reduced to `1` and we can have `n` for the symbolic result.  Or am I demanding too much?\n@smichr so we need to return KroneckerDelta(i,j) instead of S.one and S.zero? Is that what you mean?\n> so we need to return KroneckerDelta(i,j) instead of S.one and S.zero\r\n\r\nAlthough that would work, it's probably overkill. How about returning:\r\n\r\n```\r\neq = Eq(i, j)\r\nif eq == True:\r\n    return S.One\r\nelif eq == False:\r\n    return S.Zero\r\nreturn Piecewise((1, eq), (0, True)) # this line alone is sufficient; maybe it's better to avoid Piecewise\r\n```\n@smichr I made one PR [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12316),I added Kronecker delta,it passes the tests, could you please review it.\n@smichr  First of all I am so sorry for extremely late response. Secondly, I don't think def _entry is the culprit. _entry's job is to tell if e[i,j] is 0 or 1 depending on the values and i think it is doing it's job just fine. But the problem is that when we write e[i,j] it automatically assumes i and j are different and ignores the cases where they are ,in fact, same. I tried \r\n\r\n> '''eq = Eq(i, j)\r\nif eq == True:\r\n    return S.One\r\nelif eq == False:\r\n    return S.Zero\r\nreturn Piecewise((1, eq), (0, True)) # this line alone is sufficient; maybe it's better to avoid Piecewise'''\r\n\r\nBut it did not work. Answer is still coming as 0.\r\nAlso i fiddled around a bit and noticed some thing interesting\r\n```\r\nfor i in range(0,5):\r\n    for j in range(0,5):\r\n        print e[i,j] # e is identity matrix.\r\n```\r\nthis gives the correct output. All the ones and zeroes are there. Also,\r\n```\r\nx=0\r\nfor i in range(0,5):\r\n    for j in range(0,5):\r\n        x=x+e[i,j]\r\nprint x\r\n```\r\nAnd again it is giving a correct answer. So i think it is a problem somewhere else may be an eval error.\r\nI don't know how to solve it please explain how to do it. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\n> fiddled around a bit and noticed some thing interesting\r\n\r\nThat's because you are using literal values for `i` and `j`: `Eq(i,j)` when `i=1`, `j=2` gives `S.false`.\r\n\r\nThe modifications that I suggested work only if you don't nest the Sums; I'm not sure why the Sums don't denest when Piecewise is involved but (as @wakita demonstrated) it *is* smart enough when using KroneckerDelta to denest, but it doesn't evaluate until a concrete value is substituted.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from sympy import Q as Query\r\n>>>\r\n>>> n = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\r\n>>> i, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\r\n>>> M = MatrixSymbol('M', n, n)\r\n>>>\r\n>>> e = None\r\n>>> with assuming(Query.orthogonal(M)):\r\n...     e = refine((M.T * M).doit())\r\n...\r\n>>> g = Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1), (j, 0, n-1))\r\n>>> g.subs(n,3)\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, Eq(i, j)), (0, True)), (i, 0, 2), (j, 0, 2))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\n3\r\n\r\n# the double sum form doesn't work\r\n\r\n>>> Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1))\r\nSum(Piecewise((Sum(1, (i, 0, n - 1)), Eq(i, j)), (Sum(0, (i, 0, n - 1)), True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> _.subs(n,3)\r\nSum(Piecewise((Sum(1, (i, 0, 2)), Eq(i, j)), (Sum(0, (i, 0, 2)), True)), (j, 0, 2))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\nPiecewise((3, Eq(i, 0)), (0, True)) + Piecewise((3, Eq(i, 1)), (0, True)) + Piecewise((3, Eq(i, 2)), (0, True))\r\n\r\n# the KroneckerDelta form denests but doesn't evaluate until you substitute a concrete value\r\n\r\n>>> Sum(Sum(KroneckerDelta(i,j), (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1))\r\nSum(KroneckerDelta(i, j), (i, 0, n - 1), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, (0 <= j) & (j <= n - 1)), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> _.subs(n,3)\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, (0 <= j) & (j <= 2)), (0, True)), (j, 0, 2))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the better behavior of KroneckerDelta, perhaps the `_entry` should be written in terms of that instead of Piecewise.",

This is the last fix to potentially go in the 1.1.1 release, but I want to cut a release candidate today or tomorrow, so speak now, or hold your peace (until the next major release).\nI am away at a conference. The change should be almost identical to the fix for dense matrices, if someone can manage to get a patch in. I *might* be able to do it tomorrow.\nOkay.  I've looked this over and its convoluted...\r\n\r\n`SparseMatrix` should impliment `_eval_col_join`.  `col_join` should not be implemented.  It is, and that is what `hstack` is calling, which is why my previous patch didn't fix `SparseMatrix`s as well.  However, the patch that @asmeurer referenced ensures that `SparseMatrix.row_join(DenseMatrix)` returns a `SparseMatrix` whereas `CommonMatrix.row_join(SparseMatrix, DenseMatrix)` returns a `classof(SparseMatrix, DenseMatrix)` which happens to be a `DenseMatrix`.  I don't think that these should behave differently.  This API needs to be better thought out.\nSo is there a simple fix that can be made for the release or should this be postponed?",

The computation starts by writing 9/5 as 1 + 4/5. Then we get the base factored out, and are left with `(-1)**(4/5)` or `(-4)**(4/5)`. Somehow, the first is left alone while in the second, noticing that 4 is a square, SymPy does further manipulations, ending up by raising (-4) to the power of 4 and thus canceling the minus sign. So we get the second result.  \r\n\r\nCan it be accepted that the expression is multi-valued and which of the possible values is chosen is arbitrary? But one perhaps would like more consistency on this.\nOK, \"inequivalent\" was the wrong word. But is it reasonable to expect sympy to try to keep the same complex root choice through simplification?\nYes, I think there should be consistency there.  The issue is at the level of SymPy taking in an object like (-1)**(S(4)/5) and parsing it into an expression tree. The trees are formed in significantly different ways for different exponents: \r\n```\r\n>>> for k in range(1, 5):\r\n...     srepr((-4)**(S(k)/5))\r\n'Pow(Integer(-4), Rational(1, 5))'    #  complex\r\n'Pow(Integer(-4), Rational(2, 5))'    # complex \r\n'Mul(Integer(2), Pow(Integer(-2), Rational(1, 5)))'   # complex, factoring out 2 is okay\r\n'Mul(Integer(2), Pow(Integer(2), Rational(3, 5)))'    # real, where did the minus sign go? \r\n```",

            "hints_text": "In this regard, don't you think that `r.simplify()` is wrong? It returns `-a/b` which is not correct if b=a.\n`simplify` works for the generic case. SymPy would be hard to use if getting a+b from `simplify((a**2-b**2)/(a-b))` required an explicit declaration that a is not equal to b. (Besides, there is currently no way to express that declaration to `simplify`, anyway). This is part of reason we avoid `simplify` in code:  it can change the outcome in edge cases. \r\n\r\nThe fundamental issue here is: for what kind of expression `expr` do we want expr/expr to return 1? Current behavior:\r\n\r\nzoo / zoo   # nan\r\n(zoo + 3) / (zoo + 3)   # nan\r\n(zoo + a) / (zoo + a)    # 1  \r\n(zoo + a) / (a - zoo)   # 1 because -zoo is zoo  (zoo is complex infinity)  \r\n\r\nThe rules for combining an expression with its inverse in Mul appear to be too lax. \r\n\r\nThere is a check of the form `if something is S.ComplexInfinity`... which returns nan in the first two cases, but this condition is not met by `zoo + a`. \r\n\r\nBut using something like `numerator.is_finite` would not work either, because most of the time, we don't know if a symbolic expression is finite. E.g., `(a+b).is_finite` is None, unknown,  unless the symbols were explicitly declared to be finite.\r\n\r\nMy best idea so far is to have three cases for expr/expr: \r\n\r\n1. expr is infinite or 0: return nan\r\n2. Otherwise, if expr contains infinities (how to check this efficiently? Mul needs to be really fast), return expr/expr without combining \r\n3. Otherwise, return 1\n\"But using something like numerator.is_finite would not work either\"\r\n\r\nI had thought of something like denom.is_zero. If in expr_1/expr_2 the denominator is zero, the fraction is undefined. The only way to get a value from this is to use limits. At least i would think so.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was that sympy first simplifies and then substitutes. But then, the result should be -1. \r\n\r\n(zoo+a)/(a-zoo) # 1\r\nexplains what happens, but i had expected, that\r\nzoo/expr leads to nan and expr/zoo leads to nan as well.\r\n\r\nI agree, that Mul needs to be really fast, but this is about subst. But i confess, i don't know much about symbolic math.\nzoo/3 is zoo, and 4/zoo is 0. I think it's convenient, and not controversial, to have these. \r\n\r\nSubstitution is not to blame: it replaces b by a as requested, evaluating 1/(a-a) as zoo.  This is how `r` becomes `(1/(2*a) + zoo) / (1/(2*a) - zoo)`. So far nothing wrong has happened. The problem is that (because of -zoo being same as zoo) both parts are identified as the same and then the `_gather` helper of Mul method combines the powers 1 and -1 into power 0. And anything to power 0 returns 1 in SymPy, hence the result. \r\n\r\nI think we should prevent combining powers when base contains Infinity or ComplexInfinity. For example, (x+zoo) / (x+zoo)**2  returning 1 / (x+zoo) isn't right either. \nI dont really understand what happens. How can i get the result zoo? \r\n\r\nIn my example `r.subs(b,a)` returns ` 1`,  \r\nbut `r.subs(b,-a)` returns `(zoo + 1/(2*a))/(zoo - 1/(2*a))`\r\n\r\nSo how is zoo defined? Is it `(1/z).limit(z,0)`? I get `oo` as result, but how is this related to  `zoo`? As far as i know, `zoo` is ComplexInfinity. By playing around, i just found another confusing result:\r\n\r\n`(zoo+z)/(zoo-z)` returns `(z + zoo)/(-z + zoo)`, \r\nbut\r\n`(z + zoo)/(z-zoo)` returns 1\r\n\r\nI just found, `1/S.Zero` returns `zoo`, as well as `(1/S.Zero)**2`. To me, that would mean i should not divide by `zoo`.\nThere are three infinities: positive infinity oo, negative infinity -oo, and complex infinity zoo. Here is the difference:\r\n\r\n- If z is a positive number that tends to zero, then 1/z tends to oo\r\n- if z is a negative number than tends to zero, then 1/z tends to -oo\r\n- If z is a complex number that tends to zero, then 1/z tends to zoo\r\n\r\nThe complex infinity zoo does not have a determined sign, so -zoo is taken to  be the same as zoo. So when you put `(z + zoo)/(z-zoo)` two things happen: first, z-zoo returns z+zoo (you can check this directly) and second, the two identical expressions are cancelled, leaving 1.\r\n\r\nHowever, in (zoo+z)/(zoo-z) the terms are not identical, so they do not cancel. \r\n\r\nI am considering a solution that returns NaN when Mul cancels an expression with infinity of any kind. So for example (z+zoo)/(z+zoo) and (z-oo)/(z-oo) both return NaN. However, it changes the behavior in a couple of tests, so I have to investigate whether the tests are being wrong about infinities, or something else is. \nOk. I think i got it. Thank you for your patient explanation. \r\nMaybe one last question. Should `z + zoo` result in `zoo`? I think that would be natural.",

This issue could probably be fixed by changing the order of these two functions.\nSo, if the user-input expression varies, there is no way to simplify the expression to a very simple formation, isn't it?\nI think that this issue could be fixed by changing the order of `TRmorrie` and `TR10i`. (But, of course, there may be other issues in simplification that this will not resolve.)\nThat should be easy to fix, assuming it works.

A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument.

But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n",

Did you read https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Introduction-to-contributing? \n\nHow should I remove .args? Should I try to remove ._args from object instance or add a new attribute to class Atom(), is_leave. Which when assigned as false, will raise attribute error on .args. Or if creating a new object, what attributes should it have?\n\nI think you're misunderstanding the issue. The issue is not to remove .args. Indeed, every SymPy object should have .args in order to be valid. \n\nThe issue is that the `atoms()` method currently uses `x.is_Atom` to check for \"atomic\" expressions (expressions with no subexpressions), but it really should be checking `not x.args`. It should be a simple one-line fix to the `atoms` function definition, but a new test should be added, and the full test suite run to make sure it doesn't break anything (`./bin/test` from the sympy directory). \n\nOkay. But, Basic() also return .args to be null. So will not that also appear in the result of .atoms()?\n\nYes, that's an example of an object with no args but that isn't a subclass of Atom. `atoms` should return that, because it's a leaf in the expression tree. \n\nOkay, but if I am understanding you correct, won't this test fail?\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py#L73\n\nYes, it would need to be changed.

Then I saw the items that case1 had but case2 did not. Which were all either `C.z <class 'sympy.vector.scalar.BaseScalar'>` or `C.k <class 'sympy.vector.vector.BaseVector'>`. \n\nElements of the class sympy.vector.scaler.BaseScalar or class sympy.vector.vector.BaseVector were earlier considered but not now, as they were Atom but had arguments. So what should we do?\n\nI want to fix this if no one is working on it.\n\nI am unable to figure out why 'Atom' has been assigned to 'types' .

The squarefree methods are intended for univariate polynomials. The generator should be given as an input parameter. It may be omitted if there is no danger of confusion (only one symbol in the expression). Otherwise the result may be indeterminate as shown by the [example above](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/8695#issuecomment-522278244).\n@jksuom, I'm still unclear. There is already an option to pass generators as an argument to sqf_list(). Should the function automatically find the generators present in the expression? Please guide me what should I do. \nIf there is only one symbol in the expression, then the function can find the generator automatically. Otherwise I think that exactly one symbol should be given as the generator.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to change the implementations of `sqf_list()` and related functions so that they would be based on the corresponding `Poly` methods. Then they would start by converting the input expression into `p = Poly(f, *gens, **args)` and check that `p` has exactly one generator. Then `p.sqf_list()` etc, would be called.\nThen what will happen in case of multiple generators? Just confirming, generators here refer to symbols/variables.\n> generators here refer to symbols/variables.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n> Then what will happen in case of multiple generators?\r\n\r\nI think that ValueError could be raised. It seems that some kind of result is currently returned but there is no documentation, and I don't know of any reasonable use where the ordinary factorization would not suffice.\n> If there is only one symbol in the expression, then the function can find the generator automatically. Otherwise I think that exactly one symbol should be given as the generator.\r\n> \r\n> Moreover, I would like to change the implementations of `sqf_list()` and related functions so that they would be based on the corresponding `Poly` methods.

Then `p.sqf_list()` etc, would be called.\r\n\r\n@jksuom  In the helper function __symbolic_factor_list_ of sqf_list, the expression is already being converted to polynomial and then corresponding _sqf_list_ function is called. So, I should just ensure if the number of generators passed is one?\n> I should just ensure if the number of generators passed is one?\r\n\r\nIf there is exactly one generator passed, then it is possible to call `_generic_factor_list` with the given arguments. However, it is necessary to post-process the result. In the example above, it returns\r\n\r\n    (1, [(x**2 + 1, 1), (x - 1, 2), (x - 3, 3), (x - 2, 3)])\r\n\r\nwhile `sqf_list` should return only one polynomial for each power. Therefore the two threefold factors `x - 3` and `x - 2` should be combined to give a single `(x**2 - 5*x + 6, 3)`.\r\n\r\nIt is probably quite common that no generators are given, in particular, when the expression looks like a univariate polynomial. This should be acceptable but more work is then necessary to find the number of generators. I think that it is best to convert the expression to a `Poly` object to see the generators. If there is only one, then the `sqf_list` method can be called, otherwise a `ValueError` should be raised.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the latter procedure will be more efficient even if a single generator is given.\n@jksuom I have created a PR (#18307)for the issue. I haven't done anything for multiple generator case as it was ambiguous. It would be great if you could review it. Thank you. \n@jksuom what can be done in case if the expression given is a constant (without any generators)? For example:  `sqf_list(1)`. We won't be able to construct a polynomial and PolificationFailed error will be raised.\nI think that the error can be raised. It is typical of many polynomial functions that they don't work with constant expressions.",

Users should know not to mutate something while iterating over it.\nWith regards to the above discussion, I believe it would indeed be helpful if modifying a passed list to ``uniq`` raises an error while iterating over it, because it does not immediately follow that ``uniq(f)`` would get updated if ``f`` gets updated, as the user might think something like ``uniq`` stores a copy of ``f``, computes the list of unique elements in it, and returns that list. The user may not know, that yield is being used internally instead of return.\r\n\r\nI have a doubt regarding the implementation of ``uniq``:\r\n[https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/5bfe93281866f0841b36a429f4090c04a0e81d21/sympy/utilities/iterables.py#L2109-L2124](url)\r\nHere, if the first argument, ``seq`` in ``uniq`` does not have a ``__getitem__`` method, and a TypeError is raised somehow, then we call the ``uniq`` function again on ``seq`` with the updated ``result``, won't that yield ALL of the elements of ``seq`` again, even those which have already been _yielded_? \r\nSo mainly what I wanted to point out was, that if we're assuming that the given ``seq`` is iterable (which we must, since we pass it on to the ``enumerate`` function), by definition, ``seq`` must have either ``__getitem__`` or ``__iter__``, both of which can be used to iterate over the **remaining elements** if the TypeError is raised. \r\nAlso, I'm unable to understand the role of ``result`` in all of this, kindly explain.\r\n\r\nSo should I work on the error handling bit in this function?",

At least something like this could rewrite:\r\n```julia\r\nIn [2]: sign(1+I).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                 \r\nOut[2]: sign(1 + ⅈ)\r\n```\nYou can use piecewise like\r\n```\r\nPiecewise(\r\n    (0, Eq(x, 0)),\r\n    (x / Abs(x), Ne(x, 0))\r\n)\r\n```\nOriginally this question comes from SO:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61676438/integrating-and-deriving-absolute-functions-sympy/61681347#61681347\r\n\r\nThe original question was about `diff(Abs(x))`:\r\n```\r\nIn [2]: x = Symbol('x', real=True)                                                                                                             \r\n\r\nIn [3]: Abs(x).diff(x)                                                                                                                         \r\nOut[3]: sign(x)\r\n```\r\nMaybe the result from `diff` should be a `Piecewise` or at least an `ExprCondPair` guarding against `x=0`.\nThe problem is that real-valued functions like abs, re, im, arg,... are not holomorphic and have no complex derivative. See also https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/8502.\n@jksuom could we add conditions in the `Derivative` class of the functions module which would check if the expression is an instance of a non-holomorphic function, in such a case it could raise an error or in the case of `Abs` simply  check the domain. I believe all the classes in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` could be checked.\nWould it be possible to add an `_eval_derivative` method raising an error to those functions?\nWhen would it raise?\nIf the function is non-holomorphic, there is no derivative to be returned.\nThere is a reasonable derivative of `Abs` when defined over the reals though e.g.:\r\n```julia\r\nIn [1]: x = Symbol('x', real=True)                                                                                                \r\n\r\nIn [2]: Abs(x).diff(x)                                                                                                            \r\nOut[2]: sign(x)\r\n```\nMaybe there should be two functions, one defined on reals and the other on complexes.\n> Would it be possible to add an `_eval_derivative` method raising an error to those functions?\r\n\r\nIn the `Derivative` class in `sympy.function`?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> When would it raise?\r\n\r\nAs suggested, if the function is non-holomorphic or in the case of `Abs()` it could be a check on the domain of the argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Maybe there should be two functions, one defined on reals and the other on complexes.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if there are any non-holomorphic functions on Real numbers. In my opinion only the `Abs()` function would fall in this case. Hence I think this could be done using one function only.\n```\r\ndef _eval_derivative(self, expr):\r\n    if isinstance(expr,[re, im, sign, arg, conjugate]):\r\n\traise TypeError(\"Derivative not possible for Non-Holomorphic functions\")\r\n    if isinstance(expr,Abs):\r\n\tif Abs.arg[0].free_symbols.is_complex:\r\n\t    raises TypeError(\"There is a complex argument which makes Abs non-holomorphic\")\r\n```\r\nThis is something I was thinking but I am not sure about it as `Derivative` class already has a method with the same name. I also think that appropriate changes also need to be made in the `fdiff()` method of the `Abs` class.\r\n@jksuom I wanted to know if there are more non-holomorphic functions in sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py to which an error can be raised.\nThose functions in complexes.py have a `_eval_derivative` method. Maybe that would be the proper place for raising an error if that is desired.\nAre there any other examples of functions that raise when differentiated?\r\n\r\nI just tried\r\n```julia\r\nIn [83]: n = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)                                                                             \r\n\r\nIn [84]: totient(n).diff(n)                                                                                                       \r\nOut[84]: \r\nd             \r\n──(totient(n))\r\ndn \r\n```\n@oscarbenjamin I am not sure if this is a situation when it should raise, for example: if `n` here is a prime number the derivative wrt `n` would hence be `1` . Although in sympy \r\n```\r\n>>> x = Symbol('x', real=True, prime=True)\r\n>>> totient(x).evalf()\r\nϕ(x)\r\n```\r\nis the output and not `x-1`.Maybe this kind of functionality can be added.\r\n@jksuom I think your way is correct and wanted to ask if the error to be raised is appropriately `TypeError`?\nI don't think that the totient function should be differentiable. I was just trying to think of functions where it might be an error to differentiate them.\r\n\r\nI think it's better to leave the derivative of Abs unevaluated. You might have something like `Abs(f(x))` where `f` can be substituted for something reasonable later.\n@dhruvmendiratta6 Yes, I think that `TypeError` would be the appropriate choice. Note, however, that raising errors would probably break some tests. It may be desirable to add some try-except blocks to handle those properly.\nWhat about something like this:\r\n```julia\r\nIn [21]: x = Symbol('x', real=True)                                                                                               \r\n\r\nIn [22]: f = Function('f')                                                                                                        \r\n\r\nIn [23]: e = Derivative(Abs(f(x)), x)                                                                                             \r\n\r\nIn [24]: e                                                                                                                        \r\nOut[24]: \r\nd         \r\n──(│f(x)│)\r\ndx        \r\n\r\nIn [25]: e.subs(f, cosh)                                                                                                          \r\nOut[25]: \r\nd          \r\n──(cosh(x))\r\ndx         \r\n\r\nIn [26]: e.subs(f, cosh).doit()                                                                                                   \r\nOut[26]: sinh(x)\r\n```\n@jksuom @oscarbenjamin \r\nAny suggestion on how this can be done?\r\nI think changes need to be made here\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/7c11a00d4ace555e8be084d69c4da4e6f4975f64/sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py#L605-L608\r\nto leave the derivative of `Abs` unevaluated. I tried changing this to \r\n```\r\ndef _eval_derivative(self, x):\r\n        if self.args[0].is_extended_real or self.args[0].is_imaginary:\r\n            return Derivative(self.args[0], x, evaluate=True) \\\r\n                * Derivative(self, x, evaluate=False)\r\n```\r\nwhich gives\r\n```\r\n>>> x = Symbol('x', real = True)\r\n>>> Abs(x**3).diff(x)\r\nx**2*Derivative(Abs(x), x) + 2*x*Abs(x)\r\n```\r\nBut then I can't figure out how to evaluate when the need arises.The above result,which I think is wrong, occurs even when no changes are made.\nI think rewrite in general can't avoid having situations where things are only defined correctly in the limit, unless we return a Piecewise. For example, `sinc(x).rewrite(sin)`.\n```py\r\n>>> pprint(sinc(x).rewrite(sin))\r\n⎧sin(x)\r\n⎪──────  for x ≠ 0\r\n⎨  x\r\n⎪\r\n⎩  1     otherwise\r\n```\nI made `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs()` for the `sign` class which gives the following:\r\n```\r\n>>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)\r\nPiecewise((0, Eq(x, 0)), (x/Abs(x), True))\r\n```\r\nAlthough as discussed earlier raising an error in `_eval_derivative()` causes some tests to break :\r\n```\r\nFile \"c:\\users\\mendiratta\\sympy\\sympy\\functions\\elementary\\tests\\test_complexes.py\", line 414, in test_Abs\r\n    assert Abs(x).diff(x) == -sign(x)\r\n File \"c:\\users\\mendiratta\\sympy\\sympy\\functions\\elementary\\tests\\test_complexes.py\", line 833, in test_derivatives_issue_4757\r\n    assert Abs(f(x)).diff(x).subs(f(x), 1 + I*x).doit() == x/sqrt(1 + x**2)\r\n File \"c:\\users\\mendiratta\\sympy\\sympy\\functions\\elementary\\tests\\test_complexes.py\", line 969, in test_issue_15893\r\n    assert eq.doit() == sign(f(x))\r\n```\r\nThe first two are understood but in the third one both `f` and `x` are real and still are caught by the newly raised error which doesn't make sense as I raised a `TypeError` only if the argument is not real.",

Maybe somebody else can look into the problem, why `is_integer` is set wrongly for this expression.\nThe reason `is_integer` is incorrect for the expression is because it returns here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/1b4529a95ef641c2fc15889091b281644069d20e/sympy/core/mul.py#L1274-L1277\r\nThat is due to\r\n```julia\r\nIn [1]: e = Mul(-1,Mul(1,Pow(2,-1,evaluate=False),evaluate=False),evaluate=False)                                                              \r\n\r\nIn [2]: fraction(e)                                                                                                                            \r\nOut[2]: (-1/2, 1)\r\n```\r\nIt seems that the `1/2` is carried into the numerator by fraction giving a denominator of one.\r\n\r\nYou can see the fraction function here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/1b4529a95ef641c2fc15889091b281644069d20e/sympy/simplify/radsimp.py#L1071-L1098\r\n\r\nThe check `term.is_Rational` will not match an unevaluated `Mul(1, Rational(1, 2), evaluate=False)` so that gets carried into the numerator.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the root of the problem is the fact that we have unflattened args and `Mul.make_args` hasn't extracted them:\r\n```julia\r\nIn [3]: Mul.make_args(e)                                                                                                                       \r\nOut[3]: \r\n⎛      1⎞\r\n⎜-1, 1⋅─⎟\r\n⎝      2⎠\r\n```\r\nThe `make_args` function does not recurse into the args:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/1b4529a95ef641c2fc15889091b281644069d20e/sympy/core/operations.py#L425-L428\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if `make_args` should recurse. An easier fix would be to recurse into any nested Muls in `fraction`.\nWhat about not setting `is_integer` if `evaluate=False` is set on an expression or one of its sub-expressions? Actually I think one cannot expect `is_integer` to be set correctly without evaluating.\nThat sounds like a good solution. As a safeguard, another one is to not remove the integer summands from `ceiling` if `evaluate=False`; it could be considered as an evaluation of ceiling w.r.t. its arguments.\nThere is no way to tell if `evaluate=False` was used in general when creating the `Mul`. It's also not possible in general to know if evaluating the Muls would lead to a different result without evaluating them. We should *not* evaluate the Muls as part of an assumptions query. If they are unevaluated then the user did that deliberately and it is not up to `_eval_is_integer` to evaluate them.\r\n\r\nThis was discussed when changing this to `fraction(..., exact=True)`: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19182#issuecomment-619398889\r\n\r\nI think that using `fraction` at all is probably too much but we should certainly not replace that with something that evaluates the object.\nHm, does one really need to know whether `evaluate=False` was used? It looks like all we need is the expression tree to decide if `is_integer` is set to `True`. What about setting `is_integer=True` in a conservative way, i.e. only for these expression nodes:\r\n\r\n- atoms: type `Integer`, constants `Zero` and `One` and symbols with appropriate assumptions\r\n- `Add` and `Mul` if all args have `is_integer==True`\r\n- `Pow` if base and exponent have `is_integer==True` and exponent is non-negative\r\n\r\nI probably missed some cases, but you get the general idea. Would that work? The current implementation would only change in a few places, I guess - to a simpler form. Then also for `ceiling` we do not need to check for `evaluate=False`; its implementation could remain unchanged.\nWhat you describe is more or less the way that it already works. You can find more detail in the (unmerged) #20090  \r\n\r\nThe code implementing this is in the `Mul._eval_is_integer` function I linked to above.\n@oscarbenjamin @coproc Sorry for bugging, but are there any plans about this? We cannot use sympy with Python 3.8 anymore in our package because of this...\nI explained a possible solution above:\r\n\r\n> An easier fix would be to recurse into any nested Muls in `fraction`.\r\n\r\nI think this just needs someone to make a PR for that.

There is code all over the place that assumes, either explicitly or implicitly, that expressions satisfy various conditions that are true after automatic evaluation happens. For example, if I am reading the PR correctly, there is some code that very reasonably assumes that Mul.make_args(expr) gives the terms of a multiplication. This is not true for evaluate=False because that disables flattening of arguments. \r\n\r\nIf you are working with expressions created with evaluate=False, you should always evaluate them first before trying to pass them to functions like simplify(). The result of simplify would be evaluated anyway, so there's no reason to not do this.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say I'm necessarily opposed to fixing this issue specifically, but in general I think fixes like this are untenable. There are a handful of things that should definitely work correctly with unevaluated expressions, like the printers, and some very basic expression manipulation functions. I'm less convinced it's a good idea to try to enforce this for something like the assumptions or high level simplification functions. \r\n\r\nThis shows we really need to rethink how we represent unevaluated expressions in SymPy. The fact that you can create an expression that looks just fine, but is actually subtly \"invalid\" for some code is indicative that something is broken in the design. It would be better if unevaluated expressions were more explicitly separate from evaluated ones. Or if expressions just didn't evaluate as much. I'm not sure what the best solution is, just that the current situation isn't ideal.\nI think that the real issue is the fact that `fraction` is not a suitable function to use within the core assumptions system.

I personally don't see how the following makes sense:\r\n```\r\n>>> convert_to(meter, second) \r\nmeter\r\n\r\n```\nI often do calculations with units as a failsafe check. When The operation checks out and delivers reasonable units, I take it as a sign that it went well. When it \"silently\" converts an expression into non-sensible units, this cannot be used as a failsafe check.\nI am glad someone agrees this is a problem. I suggest that the physics.units package be disabled for now as it has serious flaws.\r\n\r\nMy solution is simply to use positive, real symbolic variables for units. I worry about the conversions myself. For example: `var('J m kg s Pa', positive=True, real=True)`. These behave as proper units and don't do anything mysterious. For unit conversions, I usually just use things like `.subs({J:kg*m**2/s**2})`. You could also use substitution using `.evalf()`.\n> I suggest that the physics.units package be disabled for now\r\n\r\nThat seems a little drastic.\r\n\r\nI don't use the units module but the docstring for `convert_to` says:\r\n```\r\n    Convert ``expr`` to the same expression with all of its units and quantities\r\n    represented as factors of ``target_units``, whenever the dimension is compatible.\r\n```\r\nThere are examples in the docstring showing that the `target_units` parameter can be a list and is intended to apply only to the relevant dimensions e.g.:\r\n```\r\nIn [11]: convert_to(3*meter/second, hour)                                                                                                      \r\nOut[11]: \r\n10800⋅meter\r\n───────────\r\n    hour\r\n```\r\nIf you want a function to convert between strictly between one compound unit and another or otherwise raise an error then that seems reasonable but it probably needs to be a different function (maybe there already is one).\nHi @oscarbenjamin ! Thanks for your leads and additional information provided. I am relatively new to this and have to have a deeper look at the docstring. (Actually, I had a hard time finding the right information. I was mainly using google and did not get far enough.)\nI stand by my suggestion. As my first example shows in the initial entry \nfor this issue the result from a request that should return the original \nexpression unchanged provides a wrong answer. This is exactly equivalent \nto the example you give, except that the particular case is wrong. As \n@schniepp shows there are other cases. This module needs repair and is \nnot safely usable unless you know the answer you should get.\n\nI think the convert_to function needs fixing. I would call this a bug. I \npresently do not have time to figure out how to fix it. If somebody does \nthat would be great, but if not I think leaving it active makes SymPy's \nquality control look poor.\n\nOn 9/26/20 4:07 PM, Oscar Benjamin wrote:\n> CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Priority just comes down to what any contributor wants to work on.\r\n\r\nI suspect that there are really multiple separate issues here but someone needs to take the time to investigate the causes to find out.\nI agree that this is probably an indicator of multiple issues. My quick look at the code suggested there is something odd about the way the basis is handled and that I was not going to find a quick fix. Thus I went back to just treating units as symbols as I do in hand calculations. For teaching, I've concluded that is better anyway.\nI also ran into this issue and wanted  to share my experience.  I ran this command and got the following result. \r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> convert_to(5*ohm*2*A**2/cm, watt*m)\r\n1000*10**(18/19)*meter**(13/19)*watt**(13/19)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is obviously meaningless.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on.  I finally figured out the mistake was on my end.  I typed 'watt*m' for the target unit when what I wanted was 'watt/m.'  This is a problem mostly because if the user does not catch their mistake right away they are going to assume the program is not working.\n> I suggest that the physics.units package be disabled for now as it has serious flaws.\r\n\r\nIf we disable the module in the master branch, it will only become available after a new SymPy version release. At that point, we will be bombarded by millions of people complaining about the missing module on Github and Stackoverflow.\r\n\r\nApparently, `physics.units` is one of the most used modules in SymPy. We keep getting lots of complaints even for small changes.\n@Upabjojr I understand your reasoning. It still does not address the root problem of something wrong in how the basis set of units is handled. Could somebody at least update the instructions for `convert_to` to clearly warn about how it fails. \r\n\r\nI have other projects, so do not have time to contribute to the units package. Until this is fixed, I will continue to use plain vanilla positive real SymPy variables as units.\r\n\r\nRegards\nIt's curious that this conversation has taken so long, when just 5 minutes of debugging have revealed this simple error:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/702bceaa0dde32193bfa9456df89eb63153a7538/sympy/physics/units/util.py#L33\r\n\r\n`solve_least_squares` finds the solution to the matrix equation. In case no solution is found (like in `convert_to(joule*second, joule)`), it approximates to an inexact solution to the matrix system instead of raising an exception.\r\n\r\nSimply changing it to `.solve_least_squares` to `.solve` should fix this issue.",

Maybe this means that any mixin should always declare empty slots or it won't work properly with subclasses that have slots...\r\n\r\nI see that `EvalfMixin` has `__slots__ = ()`.\nI guess we should add empty slots to DefaultPrinting then. Probably the intention of using slots with Basic classes is to enforce immutability so this could be considered a regression in that sense so it should go into 1.7.1 I think.",

        "initialContext": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n",

Thanks for pointing out `nfloat`, but this also induces the exact same error.\r\n\r\n\r\n@jksuom I can confirm that your patch fixes the issue on my end! I can put in a PR, and add the minimal test given by @oscarbenjamin, if you would like\nOkay I can reproduce it now.\r\n\r\nThe PR would be good thanks.\r\n\r\nI think that we also need to figure out what the caching issue is though. The error should be deterministic.\r\n\r\nI was suggesting `nfloat` not to fix this issue but because it's possibly a better way of doing what you suggested.

The old assumptions system stores `None` when running a query but doesn't remove that `None` when an exception is raised.\r\n2. `Mod` calls `gcd` on the argument when it is a Piecewise and `gcd` without catching the possible exception..\r\n3. The `gcd` function raises an exception when given a `Piecewise`.\r\n\r\nThe fix suggested by @jksuom is for 2. which seems reasonable and I think we can merge a PR for that to fix using `Piecewise` with `Mod`.\r\n\r\nI wonder about 3. as well though. Should `gcd` with a `Piecewise` raise an exception? If so then maybe `Mod` shouldn't be calling `gcd` at all. Perhaps just something like `gcd_terms` or `factor_terms` should be used there.\r\n\r\nFor point 1. I think that really the best solution is not putting `None` into the assumptions dict at all as there are other ways that it can lead to non-deterministic behaviour. Removing that line leads to a lot of different examples of RecursionError though (personally I consider each of those to be a bug in the old assumptions system).\nI'll put a PR together. And, ah I see, yes you are right - good point (regarding TF float exponents).\r\n\r\nI cannot comment on 1 as I'm not really familiar with the assumptions systems. But, regarding 3, would this exception make more sense as a `NotImplementedError` in `gcd`? Consider the potential behavior where `gcd` is applied to each condition of a `Piecewise` expression:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: expr = Piecewise((x, x > 2), (2, True))\r\n\r\nIn [2]: expr\r\nOut[2]: \r\n⎧x  for x > 2\r\n⎨            \r\n⎩2  otherwise\r\n\r\nIn [3]: gcd(x, x)\r\nOut[3]: x\r\n\r\nIn [4]: gcd(2, x)\r\nOut[4]: 1\r\n\r\nIn [5]: gcd(expr, x)  # current behavior\r\nPolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\r\n\r\nIn [6]: gcd(expr, x)  # potential new behavior?\r\nOut[6]: \r\n⎧x  for x > 2\r\n⎨            \r\n⎩1  otherwise\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would be what I expect from `gcd` here. For the `gcd` of two `Piecewise` expressions, this gets messier and I think would involve intersecting sets of conditions.",

There are related issues:\r\n\r\n#11456\r\n#4367\r\n#10522\r\n\r\nIn general, there needs to be work done in the code generators to properly support matrices.\r\n\r\nAs a work around, I suggest using `ccode` and a custom template to get the result you want.",

        "initialContext": "Bug in expand of TensorProduct + Workaround + Fix\n### Error description\r\nThe expansion of a TensorProduct object stops incomplete if summands in the tensor product factors have (scalar) factors, e.g.\r\n```\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum import *\r\nU = Operator('U')\r\nV = Operator('V')\r\nP = TensorProduct(2*U - V, U + V)\r\nprint(P) \r\n# (2*U - V)x(U + V)\r\nprint(P.expand(tensorproduct=True)) \r\n#result: 2*Ux(U + V) - Vx(U + V) #expansion has missed 2nd tensor factor and is incomplete\r\n```\r\nThis is clearly not the expected behaviour. It also effects other functions that rely on .expand(tensorproduct=True), as e.g. qapply() .\r\n\r\n### Work around\r\nRepeat .expand(tensorproduct=True) as may times as there are tensor factors, resp. until the expanded term does no longer change. This is however only reasonable in interactive session and not in algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Code Fix\r\n.expand relies on the method TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct(). The issue arises from an inprecise check in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() whether a recursive call is required; it fails when the creation of a TensorProduct object returns commutative (scalar) factors up front: in that case the constructor returns a Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..)).\r\nI thus propose the following  code fix in TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() in quantum/tensorproduct.py.  I have marked the four lines to be added / modified:\r\n```\r\n    def _eval_expand_tensorproduct(self, **hints):\r\n                ...\r\n                for aa in args[i].args:\r\n                    tp = TensorProduct(*args[:i] + (aa,) + args[i + 1:])\r\n                    c_part, nc_part = tp.args_cnc() #added\r\n                    if len(nc_part)==1 and isinstance(nc_part[0], TensorProduct): #modified\r\n                        nc_part = (nc_part[0]._eval_expand_tensorproduct(), ) #modified\r\n                    add_args.append(Mul(*c_part)*Mul(*nc_part)) #modified\r\n                break\r\n                ...\r\n```\r\nThe fix splits of commutative (scalar) factors from the tp returned. The TensorProduct object will be the one nc factor in nc_part (see TensorProduct.__new__ constructor), if any. Note that the constructor will return 0 if a tensor factor is 0, so there is no guarantee that tp contains a TensorProduct object (e.g. TensorProduct(U-U, U+V).\r\n\r\n\r\n\n",
