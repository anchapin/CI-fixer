  "description": "Dependency Solver Loops: The ZeroOperator group got stuck trying to resolve version conflicts manually. The Error: Conflict between crewai, pyjwt, and pydantic-settings. The Bad Fix: The agent tried to edit requirements.txt manually multiple times, incrementing versions blindly, but kept hitting the same conflict or making syntax errors. Recommendation: Use Specialized Dependency Tools. Instead of letting the LLM guess version numbers, provide a tool that runs pip install --dry-run --report (or equivalent) to get the exact conflict explanation from the package manager. Allow the agent to 'relax' constraints (e.g., changing == to >=) rather than just guessing new specific version numbers."
