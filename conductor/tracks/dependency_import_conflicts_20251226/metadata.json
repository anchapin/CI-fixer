  "description": "Dependency & Import Conflicts\nNeonWeaver: This agent encountered an ImportPathMismatchError when it actually managed to run pytest. This indicates a structural issue where conftest.py or test files are being imported under multiple names (e.g., tests.conftest vs backend.tests.conftest), likely due to the repository's directory structure or PYTHONPATH settings.\n\nZeroOperator: Identified a valid dependency conflict where crewai requires pyjwt>=2.9.0 but the project pinned pyjwt==2.8.0. However, it could not validate the fix due to the missing pytest command mentioned above."
